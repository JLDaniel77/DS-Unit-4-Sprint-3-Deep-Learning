    "Wish you could save [Time In A Bottle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnWWj6xOleY)? With statistics you can do the next best thing - understand how data varies over time (or any sequential order), and use the order/time dimension predictively.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence is just any enumerated collection - order counts, and repetition is allowed. Python lists are a good elemental example - `[1, 2, 2, -1]` is a valid list, and is different from `[1, 2, -1, 2]`. The data structures we tend to use (e.g. NumPy arrays) are often built on this fundamental structure.\n",

    "A time series is data where you have not just the order but some actual continuous marker for where they lie \"in time\" - this could be a date, a timestamp, [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), or something else. All time series are also sequences, and for some techniques you may just consider their order and not \"how far apart\" the entries are (if you have particularly consistent data collected at regular intervals it may not matter)."

    "## Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "There's plenty more to \"traditional\" time series, but the latest and greatest technique for sequence data is recurrent neural networks. A recurrence relation in math is an equation that uses recursion to define a sequence - a famous example is the Fibonacci numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For formal math you also need a base case $F_0=1, F_1=1$, and then the rest builds from there. But for neural networks what we're really talking about are loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Recurrent neural network](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Recurrent_neural_network_unfold.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden layers have edges (output) going back to their own input - this loop means that for any time `t` the training is at least partly based on the output from time `t-1`. The entire network is being represented on the left, and you can unfold the network explicitly to see how it behaves at any given `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different units can have this \"loop\", but a particularly successful one is the long short-term memory unit (LSTM):\n",
    "\n",
    "![Long short-term memory unit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Long_Short-Term_Memory.svg/1024px-Long_Short-Term_Memory.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot going on here - in a nutshell, the calculus still works out and backpropagation can still be implemented. The advantage (ane namesake) of LSTM is that it can generally put more weight on recent (short-term) events while not completely losing older (long-term) information.\n",
    "\n",
    "After enough iterations, a typical neural network will start calculating prior gradients that are so small they effectively become zero - this is the [vanishing gradient problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem), and is what RNN with LSTM addresses. Pay special attention to the $c_t$ parameters and how they pass through the unit to get an intuition for how this problem is solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why are these cool? One particularly compelling application is actually not time series but language modeling - language is inherently ordered data (letters/words go one after another, and the order *matters*). [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) is a famous and worth reading blog post on this topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, let's use TensorFlow and Keras to train RNNs with natural language. Resources:\n",

      "b'A white Fort Worth police officer fatally shot a black woman in her home early Saturday, firing through a bedroom window while responding to a call about an open door at the residence, police said.\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficers were dispatched to the house in the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Hillside Morningside neighborhood at 2:25 a.m. after receiving an \\xe2\\x80\\x9copen structure\\xe2\\x80\\x9d call, according to a statement from the Fort Worth Police Department. A neighbor told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that he dialed a non-emergency line and requested a welfare check when he noticed that the door was ajar and the lights were on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile searching the outside of the house, police said, an officer saw someone standing near a window. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerceiving a threat the officer drew his duty weapon and fired one shot striking the person inside the residence,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d police said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAtatiana Jefferson, 28, was pronounced dead at the scene, according to police, who said the officers provided emergency medical care.\\r\\n\\r\\nBody-camera footage released by police Saturday shows two officers walking quietly around the side of the house and peering through two screen doors, then moving down a driveway into a backyard.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne officer approaches a closed first-floor window and shines a flashlight inside, then swiftly raises his gun. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he yells. A split-second later, he fires a shot through the window. He does not identify himself as an officer in the footage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the video, police released images of a firearm officers said they found at the scene, but did not indicate whether Jefferson was holding the weapon or positioned near it when the officer opened fire. Officials did not release the officer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name, describing him only as a white male who has been with the department since April 2018. He will be placed on administrative leave pending an investigation, according to the department.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shooting comes at a time when relations between law enforcement and black residents in the Dallas and Fort Worth area are already under strain following the recent trial of Amber Guyger, a white former police officer who shot and killed her unarmed black neighbor, Botham Jean, in 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier this month, following an emotionally charged courtroom saga that drew nationwide attention, a Dallas jury convicted Guyger of murder and sentenced her to 10 years in prison for killing Jean, whom she shot after mistaking his apartment for her own. Days after the sentencing, Joshua Brown, a key witness in the case, was shot and killed, stoking rumors that he was targeted because of his testimony. Police attributed Brown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death to a drug deal gone bad and emphatically denied a connection to the Guyger case, but that has not quelled concerns from some local officials and activists, who have called for an independent investigation, as The Washington Post has reported.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Amber Guyger case has sparked emotional fallout across Dallas]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not yet clear whether the officer who shot Jefferson will face criminal charges. Police said they will turn over body-camera footage and other evidence from the scene to the Tarrant County district attorney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office, which will decide whether to prosecute.\\r\\n\\r\\nLee Merritt, a prominent civil rights attorney in the Dallas area who said he is representing Jefferson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family, said the officer never should have opened fire. Jefferson was playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew when she heard what she thought was a prowler outside the bedroom window, Merritt wrote in a Facebook post Saturday. When Jefferson went to the window to see what was happening, he wrote, the officer shot her.\\r\\n\\r\\nMerritt described Jefferson as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbeautiful peaceful woman\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who had graduated from Xavier University of Louisiana and worked in pharmaceutical equipment sales. He said her mother had recently fallen ill and that Jefferson was taking care of the house while she was in the hospital. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was no reason for her to be murdered. None,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe must have justice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMerritt is also representing the families of Jean and Brown in Dallas.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Police name suspects, deny wrongdoing in death of Amber Guyger witness Joshua Brown]\\r\\n\\r\\nJefferson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s neighbor, 62-year-old James Smith, said he called police to the house in the early hours of Saturday because he thought it was unusual that the doors were open and the lights were on at that time of night. He told the Star-Telegram that he knew Jefferson and her nephew were home alone and wanted to make sure they were all right.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen officers arrived, Smith said, they parked around the corner, out of view. Shortly after, he heard the gunshot and watched several more officers run in, he told the Star-Telegram.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m shaken. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m mad. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m upset. And I feel it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s partly my fault,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Smith said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I had never dialed the police department, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99d still be alive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel safe with the police department, then who do you feel safe with? Do you just ignore crime or ignore something that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not right?\" pic.twitter.com/w7nvgtOIwy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Jack Howland (@JHowl04) October 12, 2019\\r\\n\\r\\nJefferson is one of at least 689 people who have been shot and killed by American police officers in 2019, according to a Washington Post database that tracks such shootings. Of those killed, fewer than three dozen were women, and just four were black women, according to the database.\\r\\n\\r\\nFort Worth Mayor Betsy Price released a statement Saturday promising a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomplete and thorough\\xe2\\x80\\x9d probe of Jefferson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shooting, as CBS News reported.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA young woman has lost her life, leaving her family in unbelievable grief,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Price said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll of Fort Worth must surround Atatiana Jefferson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family with prayers, love and support.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d'\n",

      "b'A South Carolina sheriff candidate is fessing up to something that has tarnished many politicians: sporting blackface.\\r\\n\\r\\nCraig Stivender, 36, released a campaign ad Tuesday in which he outlines the importance of transparency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want to tell you some things that politicians would try to hide, things that my opponents may try to use to tarnish my integrity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Republican candidate said in an television ad that began with aerial shots of the Palmetto State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s waters and woods and with slow-motion shots of Stivender shooting a gun and hugging people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe South Carolina native whose family has been in Colleton County for more than 200 years provided more detail about what he meant by that statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nSitting in a rocking chair and looking directly in the camera, Stivender revealed that he received a ticket as a 16-year-old for not having a driver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s license and that he is married for the second time. He also said he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lost his temper at work as a police officer and that he was reprimanded for his actions. He even admits to being responsible for some fender benders.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the most shocking disclosure was his admission that he wore blackface 10 years ago at a law enforcement Halloween party. The video included an image of Stivender with darkened skin in a turquoise shirt, with studs in his ear and a gold chain around his neck. He was standing next to a black woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nStivender said he dressed as Demetrius Edward \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBig Meech\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Flenory, one of the leaders of the Detroit-based Black Mafia Family who was sentenced to 30 years in prison for drug trafficking and money laundering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a police officer, the exact opposite would be a gang member,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stivender said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I picked.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPoliticians on the left and right of the political spectrum have had to make public apologies for past acts of blackface, a historically racist form of theater in which a nonblack person paints themselves dark as a means to ridicule and mock black people.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier in the year, Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s old medical school yearbook surfaced, showing on Northam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yearbook page a person in blackface next to another person dressed as a Ku Klux Klan member. He initially took blame and then later said he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in the photo. Northam, who was elected with great help from black voter turnout, met with black leaders and vowed to complete the rest of his term focused on racial equity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, apologized to her state for a blackface skit she participated in 52 years ago. She has since faced calls for her resignation but has stayed in office.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross the northern border, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized for multiple images that surfaced last month of him in blackface and brownface. He has admitted that he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know any better at the time the incidents occurred and has moved his talking points to other issues as he faces a reelection campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nStivender said he understands the disappointment of those \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho may be upset\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but argued that honesty was most important to his nascent campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat was a different time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday we understand that type of costume is troubling to many.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe told ABC News 4 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 based in Mount Pleasant, S.C. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what blackface was 10 years ago and that it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t his intention to offend anyone. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t apologize for his action when reporter Kate Mosso asked if he would.\\r\\n\\r\\nStivender\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign said in an email that it stands behind previous statements and that the campaign has received mostly positive attention from the local community.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat attention, according to conservative and liberal political strategists, could be a toss-up with voters.\\r\\n\\r\\nMatt Moore, the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s former GOP chairman and a partner at political consulting firm First Tuesday Strategies in Columbia, S.C., called Stivender\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ad a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrain wreck\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and said Stivender\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim that he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean to offend and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know about blackface 10 years ago is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjoke.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMoore noted that had an opponent uncovered Stivender\\xe2\\x80\\x99s past, it probably would have been a one-day story, instead of being the central issue of his campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoore said the low-country region of South Carolina has a sordid history surrounding race, and Colleton County needs a sheriff who can build bridges and move the community forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to understand the context of Colleton County before completely judging the sheriff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ignorance, said longtime political consultant Wesley Donehue of South Carolina-based Push Digital. His firm has worked with Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\\r\\n\\r\\nDonehue spent part of his childhood in the county. He has never met Stivender, but he did say the sheriff hopeful\\xe2\\x80\\x99s description about the past decade is correct, pointing to the fun that was made of interracial couples in the area and his own grandfather being buried in a Confederate uniform not long ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cColleton is really stuck a decade or two behind everybody else,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said about the county of nearly 38,000. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe beauty of the Internet is it breaks down the barrier and people in those areas are starting to wise up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, Donehue believes the county\\xe2\\x80\\x99s black population is owed a personal apology.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s running for a top law enforcement position. He has a moral obligation, especially to the minority community, to explain why he did this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Donehue said, pointing to strained relations between law enforcement and communities of color.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe county, which once was home to many cotton plantations, is about 60 percent white and 37 percent black, according to census data. Its Latino population is a little over 3 percent. Most of Colleton County voters cast their ballots for President Trump in 2016; he took nearly 53 percent of its votes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree Democrats, one of whom is black, and another Republican are also running for Colleton County sheriff.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoore said the best action for Stivender to take would be to drop out because the state doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need anymore embarrassing sheriffs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least 11 of South Carolina\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sheriffs in its 46 counties have been accused of breaking laws, according to the Post and Courier.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf he really didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know [about blackface], do voters really want someone who is incapable of Googling to find out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Moore asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more:\\r\\n\\r\\nAlabama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Republican governor apologizes for wearing blackface in college, refuses to resign\\r\\n\\r\\nA Belgian festival has long featured a \\xe2\\x80\\x98savage\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in blackface.

      "b'But thanks to Devlin Hodges, Devin Bush and James Conner, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a certainty just yet. There still are possibilities for the Steelers in 2019 as they enter their bye week, thanks to a 24-17 triumph Sunday night in Carson, Calif., over the Los Angeles Chargers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nRoethlisberger, the two-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback, was nowhere to be seen. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make the trip after undergoing season-ending elbow surgery. Mason Rudolph, his replacement, was on the sideline after suffering a concussion a week earlier on a hit by Baltimore Ravens safety Earl Thomas that put the brutality of football, even in its current safety-enhanced version, on vivid display.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Steelers were on the road (allegedly) with a rookie third-string quarterback making his first NFL start as they attempted to keep their record from plummeting to 1-5.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo problem, as it turned out.\\r\\n\\r\\nHodges gave a solid performance. Bush, a dynamic rookie linebacker, and Conner, the third-year tailback who was a Pro Bowl selection last season while Bell sat out in a contract dispute, more than did their parts. The Steelers raced to an early lead and held on late.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI felt calm, cool and collected,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hodges told NBC after the game. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a couple plays I wish I had back. The interception, I wish I could take back. But at the end of the day, we got the win. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all that matters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSteelers fans were waving their Terrible Towels as they took over the cozy Dignity Health Sports Park. They watched the Steelers seize a 14-0 advantage in the first quarter as Bush, the 10th overall selection in this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s NFL draft out of Michigan, scored a touchdown after picking up the ball off the turf on a backward pass by Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers, then set up a touchdown with a tipped-ball interception.\\r\\n\\r\\nHodges is a far lower-profile NFL newcomer, as an undrafted rookie out of Samford playing only because of the injuries to Roethlisberger and Rudolph. But he threw for more than 14,500 yards in college and broke Steve McNair\\xe2\\x80\\x99s FCS record for career passing yards.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nHe received more pregame attention for being a champion duck-caller given the nickname, naturally, of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDuck.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But he was poised in the pocket and accurate with his throws Sunday in a 15-for-20, 132-yard passing performance. He threw a touchdown pass to Conner and played mistake-free football until a fourth-quarter interception. The Steelers took a decidedly low-risk approach with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy mind-set going into the game, with it being Duck\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first start, was I just had to up my level of play to try to make the game as easy as possible for him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Conner said on NBC afterward. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe had to score on defense, which we did that. I had to just play big to make the game easier for him. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what the game plan was.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nConner also ran for a touchdown as the Steelers improved their record to 2-4. Rudolph presumably will regain the quarterback job from Hodges after the bye. But Tomlin now knows that he has some enviable depth at the position.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThis has been a different sort of season for an organization so accustomed to stability and success. There have been reports that the Washington Redskins, after firing Jay Gruden as their coach, could make an offseason run at Tomlin.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut whether Redskins owner Daniel Snyder is an admirer of Tomlin, the Steelers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 history under the ownership of the Rooney family is that they simply do not get rid of coaches. Tomlin has two seasons left on his contract after this season. The likely outcome is that Tomlin remains in Pittsburgh and the Steelers, whether they get back into playoff contention this season, retool with Roethlisberger back in the lineup next season and try to recapture their past Super Bowl success.\\r\\n\\r\\nTomlin and his staff did a masterful job Sunday making things work with Hodges. It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hurt that the Chargers, whose record dropped to 2-4, gave a feeble performance for three quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chargers were expected to be a top AFC contender this season after reaching the playoffs last season. Now they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even win at home against a rookie third-string quarterback. They trailed, 24-0, in the fourth quarter before finally getting going with a field goal and two touchdown passes from Rivers to tight end Hunter Henry, who was playing his first game since suffering a tibial plateau fracture in his knee in the season opener.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chargers, after a Steelers punt, got the ball back at their 1-yard line with 1:03 remaining and no timeouts left. Rivers threw an interception with 41 seconds to play to seal the outcome, much to the delight of the home-away-from-home crowd.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if this is a road game,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hodges said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI mean, Steeler Nation really came out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, thanks in part to the play of Hodges, all those Steelers fans were delighted with what they saw.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn-game updates\\r\\n\\r\\n4th Quarter\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nChargers make it interesting: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably going to be too little, too late. But the Chargers have made it interesting with 17 straight fourth-quarter points. Philip Rivers threw a second touchdown pass to tight end Hunter Henry, this time an 11-yarder. The Chargers have all three timeouts remaining and can get the ball back if they get a stop on defense. (Steelers 24, Chargers 17 with 1:29 left in the 4th quarter)\\r\\n\\r\\nTD for Chargers: The Chargers finally have reached the end zone, courtesy of a five-yard touchdown pass from Philip Rivers to tight end Hunter Henry. Henry is playing his first game since suffering a tibial plateau fracture in his knee in the season opener. He made a nice catch in the back of the end zone and just managed to get both feet down in bounds. (Steelers 24, Chargers 10 with 7:13 left in the 4th quarter)\\r\\n\\r\\nChargers get FG: The Chargers, at least, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be shut out. They got a 38-yard field goal by rookie kicker Chase McLaughlin a minute into the fourth quarter. (Steelers 24, Chargers 3 with 14:00 minutes left in the 4th quarter)\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n3rd Quarter\\r\\n\\r\\nBush returns to field: Rookie linebacker Devin Bush was back on the field for Pittsburgh\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first defensive series of the second half. The Steelers forced a punt by the Chargers. (Steelers 24, Chargers 0 with 6:39 left in the 3rd quarter)\\r\\n\\r\\nFG for Steelers: The Steelers are controlling the clock and the game. They held the ball for nearly half of the third quarter and got a 20-yard field goal by kicker Chris Boswell to up their lead to 24 points. Rookie quarterback Devlin Hodges kept his cool on a third-and-goal play from the 2-yard line when the football got past him on a low snap out of shotgun formation. Hodges ran the ball down and picked it up around the 20-yard line, then managed to run to his right and avoid an intentional grounding penalty with an incompletion on a throw out of bounds. (Steelers 24, Chargers 0 with 8:12 left in the 3rd quarter)\\r\\n\\r\\nHalftime in Carson: Steelers fans, waving their Terrible Towels, have taken over the cozy Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, Calif., the supposed home of the Chargers. And their team has given them plenty about which to cheer, with a three-touchdown lead at halftime for the Steelers. Two rookies, quarterback Devlin Hodges and linebacker Devin Bush, and third-year tailback James Conner have led the way. Bush, the 10th overall selection in the NFL draft out of Michigan, scored the Steelers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 first touchdown when he picked up the football off the turf after a backward pass by Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers and ran nine yards to the end zone. Bush set up the second touchdown with an interception before leaving the field later in the half with an apparent ankle or leg injury. Conner scored two touchdowns, one on a run and one on a catch of a swing pass thrown by Hodges, the undrafted rookie from Samford making his first NFL start after the Steelers lost top quarterbacks Ben Roethlisberger and Mason Rudolph to injuries. Hodges has completed eight of nine passes for 70 yards. It was a dreadful first half for the Chargers, who did next to nothing right on offense or defense and watched rookie kicker Chase McLaughlin miss a 43-yard field goal attempt when the ball clanked off the left upright. They were expected to be a top AFC contender this season after reaching the playoffs last season. Instead, the Chargers are losing at home to a rookie third-string quarterback and, barring a big second-half comeback, will see their record drop to 2-4. (Steelers 21, Chargers 0 at halftime)\\r\\n\\r\\n2nd Quarter\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nChargers miss FG: Nothing is going right for the Chargers. Rookie kicker Chase McLaughlin missed a 43-yard field goal attempt when the ball clanked off the left upright. Coach Anthony Lynn opted for the kick instead of a fourth-and-six try from the Pittsburgh 25-yard line. (Steelers 21, Chargers 0 with 32 seconds left in the 2nd quarter)\\r\\n\\r\\nDevin Bush hurt: Steelers linebacker Devin Bush left the field with an apparent ankle or leg injury. He is receiving attention on the Steelers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sideline from members of the team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s medical staff. Bush has had a superb game with a touchdown on a fumble recovery and an interception to set up another touchdown.\\r\\n\\r\\nTD pass for Hodges: Devlin Hodges\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first NFL touchdown pass has upped the Steelers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lead over the Chargers to 21-0. It was a 26-yarder to tailback James Conner on a swing pass to the right. The Steelers kept the ball for 14 plays and 9 minutes, 9 seconds on the drive and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dominating the Chargers. Hodges, the undrafted rookie from Samford making his first NFL start, has completed eight of nine passes for 70 yards. (Steelers 21, Chargers 0 with 6:34 left in the 2nd quarter)\\r\\n\\r\\n1st Quarter\\r\\n\\r\\nSteelers turn Bush interception into TD: This game has been a showcase, so far, for Steelers rookie linebacker Devin Bush. His tipped-ball interception gave the Steelers possession of the ball at the L.A. 40-yard line, and they cashed in with a 12-yard touchdown run by tailback James Conner. So Bush, the 10th overall selection in this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s NFL draft out of Michigan, has scored one Steelers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 touchdown with a return of a fumble recovery and set up the other one with an interception. (Steelers 14, Chargers 0 with 4:29 left in the 1st quarter)\\r\\n\\r\\nDefensive TD for Steelers: The Steelers have an early lead thanks to a touchdown by their defense on an eyesore of a play by quarterback Philip Rivers and the Chargers. Rivers, under pass-rush pressure, tried to get the football to running back Melvin Gordon on his right. But Rivers\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pass was backward and fell to the turf for what was ruled a lateral and a fumble charged to Rivers. Steelers rookie linebacker Devin Bush picked up the ball off the ground and ran nine yards for the touchdown. (Steelers 7, Chargers 0 with 10:51 left in the 1st quarter)\\r\\n\\r\\nBad first throw by Hodges: Undrafted rookie Devlin Hodges, making his first NFL start for the Steelers, had wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster open on Pittsburgh\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first offensive play. But Hodges\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pass was underthrown and the ball fell incomplete. Hodges did complete a third-down pass short of the first down and the Steelers punted. That came after the Chargers punted on the game\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opening possession, with the many Steelers fans in the crowd in Carson, Calif., chanting for the Pittsburgh defense. Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers limped a bit on his way off the field after absorbing a hit after delivering a throw on the opening series. (Steelers 0, Chargers 0 with 11:06 left in the 1st quarter)'\n",

(iStock)\\r\\n\\r\\nColumnist\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re covered under Medicare, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let complacency prevent you from reviewing your health insurance options and maybe saving some money.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpen enrollment for Medicare begins Oct. 15 and ends Dec. 7. It is during this period that those covered by Medicare \\xe2\\x80\\x94 people 65 and older \\xe2\\x80\\x94 can change their health plan and prescription drug coverage for 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many people, the Medicare open-enrollment process can be confusing with its alphabet plans. Part A is hospital insurance, Part B is medical insurance, Part C is Medicare Advantage (offered by private companies approved by Medicare such as an HMO) and Part D is prescription drug coverage. Even if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been happy with your coverage, open enrollment is the time to double check what you have and make changes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[It's a good deal for most older Americans but Medicare is neither free nor easy]\\r\\n\\r\\nYou should have received your \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlan Annual Notice of Change,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which lists any changes in your plan, such as a possible increase in cost or coverage areas. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important that you review this document. The notice will compare the benefits in 2020 with those you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re currently receiving. Be sure to check your prescription drug plan to ensure that the medications you need will still be covered. If a drug you take is no longer covered, you may want to switch plans. If you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get your notice, which should have been mailed last month, contact your plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo help you review your options, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have redesigned the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMedicare Plan Finder\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on medicare.gov\\r\\n\\r\\nMedicare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Plan Finder makes it easier to compare coverage options and shop for plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve just updated the Medicare Plan Finder with 2020 \\xe2\\xad\\x90 ratings for #Medicare health & drug plans. Star ratings help you compare the quality of health & drug plans as you review coverage options during #MedicareOE, which starts Tuesday, Oct. 15. https://t.co/ttRZpQVVtr pic.twitter.com/6n1eSLonRn \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Medicare.gov (@MedicareGov) October 11, 2019\\r\\n\\r\\nIn reviewing your plan, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just focus on prices. You should balance affordability with coverage, making sure your plan provides the health services you need.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nonprofit Medicare Rights Center has put together a free online reference tool that can help walk you thorough your choices. The consumer service organization also pointed out some updates for 2020:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 This year, Medicare Advantage Plans were allowed more flexibility in offering certain benefits such as nutrition services or in-home supports, and home modifications. In 2020, plans are allowed to offer more services to certain members with chronic conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 The average Medicare prescription drug plan premium for 2020 is down slightly to $32.74 per month from $33.19.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) addresses some common questions in its Medicare open enrollment FAQs section. For example, here are a few questions answered by KFF.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQ: My husband and I are retired. He just turned 65 and is covered under Medicare, but I am 62 and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have health insurance. As the spouse of a Medicare beneficiary, can I enroll in Medicare during the open enrollment period?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKFF: No. Although your husband now qualifies for Medicare, you will not qualify for Medicare until you turn age 65. If you do not have health insurance now, you can consider signing up for health insurance coverage through a Marketplace plan\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQ: I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sign up for Part B when I first became eligible, but want to sign up now. I know there is a penalty for late enrollment. Is there any way to avoid the penalty?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKFF: Generally, no. In most cases, if you missed your Part B enrollment window, which runs from the three months before the month of your 65th birthday through the three months after the month of your 65th birthday, you will face a late enrollment penalty once you do enroll, which will be added to your premium costs for the remainder of your enrollment. The penalty equals 10 percent of the standard monthly premium for each 12-month period that you delayed enrollment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you did not enroll for Part B during your initial enrollment period, you may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) to sign up for Part B (and/or Part A) anytime as long as you or a spouse is working and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re covered by a group health plan through that employment. For people age 65 or over who have coverage through a group health plan, there is also an 8-month SEP, which starts the month after the employment ends, or the group health plan coverage ends. If you sign up during an SEP, the late enrollment penalty will not apply.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information on the late penalty for Part B click here.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information on the late penalty for Part D click here.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you need help with Medicare, call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) or go to Medicare.gov.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more:\\r\\n\\r\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get paralyzed by open enrollment \\xe2\\x80\\x94 just do it\\r\\n\\r\\nGetting the most out of Medicare\\r\\n\\r\\nYour Thoughts\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you review your plan during Medicare open enrollment?

      "b'\\r\\n\\r\\nA classic way to lie with charts is by starting a bar chart with a non-zero baseline, as in the graphic on the left, which is adapted from a chart produced by Fox Business in 2011. By starting the y-axis at 34 percent, small differences can be exaggerated. (Alberto Cairo/How Charts Lie)\\r\\n\\r\\nAlberto Cairo wants to make you smarter about charts.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a professor of visual journalism at the University of Miami, and his third book, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow Charts Lie,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is geared toward helping people make better sense of the charts, maps and other data visualizations that flood our social media feeds and nightly newscasts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the current political environment, he notes in the book, misinformation is everywhere. A slick chart can add a veneer of authority to shoddy or misleading data, he said, so he made it his goal to help readers avoid the common interpretive pitfalls that took him years to figure out for himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier this month I spoke with Cairo about the book, his background and some of the misleading viral visuals he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s come across recently. The conversation below has been edited for length and clarity.\\r\\n\\r\\nTell me a bit about your background, like how you ended up in this field?\\r\\n\\r\\nI studied journalism, originally with the goal of working in radio (I love listening to the radio and podcasts). However, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always been in love with visual communication. My dad taught me how to draw a bit, and I read comic books and science books with tons of cutaway illustrations and visual explainers when I was a kid.\\r\\n\\r\\nI guess I absorbed all that and, in the last year of my B.A., a professor of mine who knew that I can sketch stuff up recommended me to be an intern in the infographics department at the local newspaper of the city where I was born, La Coru\\xc3\\xb1a, in Spain. The newspaper is La Voz de Galicia. After that, it was just a matter of practicing, learning, studying, making mistakes and trying to learn from them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho is this book for? What audience did you have in mind when you wrote it?\\r\\n\\r\\nI wrote the book with different \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpersonas\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in mind, to use the parlance common in design research. For instance, my dad and my mom. They are both educated professionals (a medical doctor and the head of nursing in several hospitals, both retired).\\r\\n\\r\\nMy dad and my mom both know a bit about numbers, but I observed in people like them (and even myself, I admit), the tendency to take charts, maps and graphs at face value, assuming that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca picture is worth a thousand words,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a myth I warn against in the book.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some reason many people assume that numbers and, as an extension of numbers, the graphics that represent them, are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cobjective\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and carry truth. The goal of the book is to disabuse people of this intuition. Sure, visualizations are amazing and they can open your eyes to insights you hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed before (and I exemplify that in the book), but they need to be approached carefully as written text or speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy write this book now? Have you been noticing a lot of misinformation, or maybe misinterpretation, among the public on this visual stuff?\\r\\n\\r\\nVisual misinformation has always been something that has worried me. I addressed it in previous books. However, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve noticed an increase in the past few years in countries I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve lived in: Spain, Brazil, and the U.S. I noticed that governments, companies and individuals have become more adept at designing misleading charts.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust see this example from yesterday:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cReal median household income\\xe2\\x80\\x94the amount earned by those in the very middle\\xe2\\x80\\x94hit $65,084 for the 12 months ending in July. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the highest level ever and a gain of $4,144, or 6.8%, since Mr. Trump took office.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d @WSJ pic.twitter.com/Sna9DHbnyV \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) October 2, 2019\\r\\n\\r\\nNotice the absurd trend line during Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidency.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, walk me through this \\xe2\\x80\\x94 what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening in this chart? What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s misleading about it?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we want to have an informed conversation about economic development, wages, jobs, et cetera, we need to consider not just the quantitative realities, but also the qualitative ones: What hides behind the slump at the beginning of [Barack] Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidency and the recovery at its end? The biggest economic crisis since the Depression.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why the curve is so steep. Tracing a trend line between one point at its beginning and the end of the presidency is absurd just because that line doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t describe at all the realities behind the data. Moreover, the growth during [Donald] Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidency is simply an extension of trends that were existing before: You can see that if we trace a trend line since 2010 up to the present.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not to diminish more recent growth. The fact that the economy has continued improving steadily, that employment has gone up, that wages have continued increasing \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great news on its own. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not something that began in November 2016 or January 2017. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an inherited situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing that struck me about this chart is it appears to be from the Wall Street Journal? So you have to assume that their intention wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t to lead folks astray here, but it ended up happening anyway?\\r\\n\\r\\nExactly! And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a point in the book, which contains mostly charts that were NOT designed in purpose to mislead anyone but that are at risk to be misread, particularly if they are related to deeply held ideological beliefs. As I wrote, charts often lie because we are all prone to lying to ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good news is that I believe that we can curb this impulse a bit if we are more informed and more careful, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I try to teach in the book. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d add: even teaching to MYSELF, as most of the mistakes when reading charts that I describe in the book are mistakes I have made myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo this kind of segues into my next question: the title is how charts lie, which is a great title. But like, who is doing the lying, exactly?\\r\\n\\r\\nA more accurate title would have been How Charts Mislead, Deceive, and Lie, How We Lie to Ourselves With Them, How We Can Avoid That Happening, and How We Can Use Charts Instead to Inform Meaningful Conversations About Urgent Issues. But nobody would buy a book like that!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the more egregious examples of a lying chart, left, was shared by Utah Republican Jason Chaffetz in a 2015 congressional hearing. The lines were drawn to different scales, falsely implying that Planned Parenthood performed more abortions than cancer screenings. Cairo redrew the chart, right, using a proper scale. (Alberto Cairo/How Charts Lie)\\r\\n\\r\\nBut yes, charts do lie. Because reading a chart is not something that happens in the chart itself. It happens in the interface between the visual object AND your brain. And our brains are very prone to seeing what is not really there, to project onto charts what we already believe, to read beyond what the chart is showing (that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why I came up with the mantra: \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca chart shows only what it shows and nothing else.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Everything else that you see in a chart is often in your brain, not in the chart).\\r\\n\\r\\nHow do you generally recommend people approach charts, like the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshocking\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstunning\\xe2\\x80\\x9d viral charts they may see on their social feeds? What would you want a person who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s considering sharing a chart like this to do?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sagan Standard is timeless: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The more striking, shocking or stunning a chart is, the higher our scrutiny of it should be. In the book, I describe things to look into when facing any chart: checking the source of its data (if a chart doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention the source, ignore it, period); also, if you have a minute, visit the source itself to see whether the chart is measuring what it claims to be measuring. In one of my previous books, I have this example of several sources of worldwide data on intrafamily violence against women reporting hugely different rates for the same countries. Why? Because they defined \\xe2\\x80\\x9cviolence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in different ways. In the case of the source reporting lower rates, they were only counting physical violence; in the case of the source with higher rates, they also counted verbal violence, and other forms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter assessing what the chart is truly measuring and showing, we need to pay attention to how the information is displayed: Is the chart or map distorting the data, maybe to emphasize points that favor the author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinions or agendas? Have the axis of a graph been cropped to exaggerate or minimize differences or variations?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most important point, though, is to remind ourselves that we all project; therefore the mantra \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca chart shows only what it shows and nothing else\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is a good heuristic. The more the apparent message of a chart aligns with your ideological beliefs, the more you should force yourself to read it carefully, just because we are all prone to liking that chart beforehand and take it at face value. We all tend to do the opposite: scrutinize more closely charts whose message we disagree with. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of work, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth it.'\n",

People have lots of opinions about it.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTipping isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just a restaurant issue,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Elliott said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGratuities affect a wide range of service workers, from hotel housekeepers to tour guides. And this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t about depriving servers, housekeepers or tour guides of their salary. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about truth in advertising.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s for a hotel room, a restaurant meal or even a muffin, businesses owe it to their customers to be upfront about the true and full cost, Elliott said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne of the tenets of capitalism is that you tell the truth about your prices,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo if you say that this cup of coffee is going to cost $2, then you should be able to pay $2 for it. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the end of the transaction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not happening, which is causing tipping fatigue, especially for travelers. The economics of the service industry has shifted to make it the direct responsibility of the customers to subsidize the salary of the workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nTips are no longer really optional.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing on a cruise? There are a number of people who will expect a tip. That scuba-diving excursion means tipping the guide.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get Elliott (or anyone else, for that matter) started on how airline tickets are priced. Spirit Airlines charges travelers to have a customer service agent print out a boarding pass. Does it really cost $10 to print out a piece of paper?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s at the point where travelers need to pack a lot of cash just to tip all the people helping them along their journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nElliott, meanwhile, is opposed to the suggestion that restaurant customers tip 20 percent, no matter the quality of service.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA mandatory 20 percent tip is a slippery slope,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already seen how it plays out in the travel industry. Cruise lines now \\xe2\\x80\\x98automatically\\xe2\\x80\\x99 add tips to your final bill. In coffee shops, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting hit up for a tip before you get your beverage.

The general tipping guide for the Emily Post Institute on etiquette says you tip pretax.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, some servers argue that quibbling over whether you should tip pre- or post- the tax is petty.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say your meal pretax comes to $100.

      "b'Robert Forster, a brooding, ruggedly handsome Hollywood actor who was featured alongside Marlon Brando and Gregory Peck in the late 1960s, became a B-movie action star playing lawmen and thugs, and revived his career with an Oscar-nominated turn in Quentin Tarantino\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJackie Brown,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d died Oct. 11 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 78.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cause was brain cancer, said his publicist, Kathie Berlin. Mr. Forster\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death coincided with the release of his latest film, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEl Camino,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a spinoff of the AMC series \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBreaking Bad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in which he played a fixer who fashions a new identity for Bryan Cranston\\xe2\\x80\\x99s meth kingpin.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Forster began his film career as an Army private who, in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReflections in a Golden Eye\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (1967), gallops naked through the woods atop a black stallion, catching the eye of Brando and Elizabeth Taylor. More than four decades later, he found himself promoted to general, playing a military leader in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOlympus Has Fallen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (2013), an action thriller about a terrorist attack on the White House.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn between came dozens of roles as cops, detectives and straight-talking heavies, in grindhouse pictures with names like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cScanner Cop II: Volkin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Revenge\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoint of Seduction: Body Chemistry III.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy career went upwards for about five years and then downwards for about 27 years,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Forster told New York magazine in 2018, recalling his working life before \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJackie Brown\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (1997), in which he played a melancholy bail bondsman named Max Cherry. The part was written for him by Tarantino, a former video-rental clerk who had admired Mr. Forster in movies such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMedium Cool\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (1969), a countercultural touchstone by filmmaker Haskell Wexler, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Delta Force\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (1986), in which he played a Lebanese terrorist pursued by Chuck Norris and Lee Marvin.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Forster, who traced his ancestry to Italy, England and Ireland, was often cast against ethnic type, enlisted to play Native American figures or foreign despots such as Manuel Antonio Noriega of Panama and Moammar Gaddafi of Libya. Reviewing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDelta Force,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Roger Ebert wrote that he \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgives a frighteningly good performance, intense and uncompromising,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and kept the film \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfrom becoming just an action comic book.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Forster at the 2018 premiere of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat They Had.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Mario Anzuoni/Reuters)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years he worked with directors including Alexander Payne, as George Clooney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father-in-law in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Descendants\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (2011), and David Lynch, as a detective in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMulholland Drive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (2001) and as Sherrif Frank Truman in the 2017 Showtime revival of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwin Peaks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Mr. Forster had previously been offered the part of Truman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawman brother, Harry, for the series\\xe2\\x80\\x99 original run in the early 1990s; he turned it down because he was working on another show, and the role went to Michael Ontkean.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Forster\\xe2\\x80\\x99s late-career renaissance marked a return to the more artistically ambitious fare of his 1960s heyday, which began with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGolden Eye\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (1995), directed by John Huston and adapted from a novel by Carson McCullers. Mr. Forster had never made a movie \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or ridden a horse \\xe2\\x80\\x94 before the film, and told the pop culture website the A.V. Club that he was handed the equivalent of a tan jockstrap for his infamous equestrian nude scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ultimately tossed the cloth covering into the bushes, and recalled thinking: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c \\xe2\\x80\\x98Bob, if you are afraid to be naked on this horse, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d better quit, because if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it with full abandon, with absolute abandon, then you have no right to be an actor. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99d better quit now.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And that was the moment I said to myself, \\xe2\\x80\\x98All right, just go with it, Bob.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Forster appeared alongside Peck in a Western, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Stalking Moon\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (1968), and beginning in 1971 played the hard-boiled lead of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBanyon,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d an NBC detective series set in 1930s Los Angeles. The show was canceled after about a dozen episodes, kicking off Mr. Forster\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self-described \\xe2\\x80\\x9c27-year slump\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 during which he starred in the short-lived police series \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNakia\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and appeared in movies such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Black Hole\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (1979), \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlligator\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (1980) and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVigilante\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (1982).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs acting jobs dried up, he also found work as a drama teacher and motivational speaker, urging companies, organizations and (on at least one occasion) a group of imprisoned white-collar criminals to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeliver excellence right now\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnever quit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n1 of 60 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \\xc3\\x97 Notable deaths in 2019: Ric Ocasek, Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year View Photos Remembering those who have died in 2019.

(He later added an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cr\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to Foster after learning another actor shared his name.) His father was a Ringling Bros. elephant trainer who became an executive at a baking supply company; his mother was a homemaker.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey divorced when Mr. Forster was 8, and his mother later killed herself after Mr. Forster received his draft notice in 1966. In part, he told the New York Times, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe was hysterical about the thought of my going to Vietnam.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Forster received a deferment, partly through medical statements describing the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdevastating psychological effects\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of his mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Forster studied history and psychology at the University of Rochester, where he was mulling a career as a lawyer, when he spotted a young woman in a black leather raincoat. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs I was trying to think of what to say, I followed her into an auditorium,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he recalled in a Rochester alumni magazine interview.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents were auditioning for a production of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBye Bye Birdie;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the woman, June Provenzano, was a crew member. Mr. Forster landed a role in the chorus and fell in love with both acting and Provenzano, whom he married in 1966.

Survivors include his partner of 16 years, Denise Grayson; a son from a relationship, Bobby Forster; three daughters from his first marriage, Elizabeth Foster Howell, Maeghen Perry Dimperio and Kate Forster Simmons; and four grandchildren.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn interviews, Mr. Forster rarely shied away from discussing the fallow period in the middle of his career, and the toll it took on him and his family. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEvery time it reached a lower level I thought I could tolerate, it dropped some more, and then some more,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told the Chicago Tribune last year. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNear the end I had no agent, no manager, no lawyer, no nothing.

      "b'Alexei Leonov, a Soviet cosmonaut who in 1965 became the first person to walk in space and who was scheduled to walk on the moon before the Soviet Union abandoned its efforts for a manned lunar landing, died Oct. 11 in Moscow. He was 85.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian space agency, Roscosmos, announced his death but did not cite a cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Leonov, a Soviet air force officer, was chosen in 1959 as part of his country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inaugural class of astronauts \\xe2\\x80\\x94 known as cosmonauts in the old Soviet Union. At the time, the Soviets were leading the space race, a symbolic and strategic battle for technological superiority during the Cold War.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first satellite to orbit Earth. In April 1961, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a close friend of Mr. Leonov\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x94 became the first person launched into space.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the U.S. space program tried to catch up, with flights by Alan B. Shepard Jr. and John Glenn, the Soviets sought new ways to maintain their early edge. Mr. Leonov began training for his spacewalk in 1963.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe underwent a rigorous program of swimming and running and was subjected to long periods of weightlessness. A special suit and helmet were made to withstand the extreme conditions in space.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Leonov in 2015. (Vasily Maximov/AFP/Getty Images)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs perilous as early space travel was, it seemed doubly dangerous for a human being to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwalk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or, more precisely, to float \\xe2\\x80\\x94 outside the safety of the capsule. On March 18, 1965, Mr. Leonov took that step.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe left the capsule through a hatch, leaving a fellow cosmonaut, Pavel Belyayev, to pilot the ship. Mr. Leonov entered an airtight chamber called an air lock and inhaled pure oxygen for almost an hour to reduce the level of nitrogen in his blood, as a means of preventing decompression sickness, or the bends.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, he opened the outer hatch and entered space, more than 100 miles above the earth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surface, connected to his capsule by a 16-foot-long tether. A skilled amateur painter, Mr. Leonov found the vista \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindescribably beautiful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI said to myself, \\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true, the Earth is round,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d he later said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis spacewalk was captured by two film cameras that produced remarkably clear images, including some in color.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was so quiet I could even hear my heart beat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Leonov told London\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Observer newspaper in 2015. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was surrounded by stars and was floating without much control. I will never forget the moment. I also felt an incredible sense of responsibility. Of course, I did not know that I was about to experience the most difficult moments of my life \\xe2\\x80\\x94 getting back into the capsule.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he attempted to reenter the air lock leading to the space capsule, Mr. Leonov could not climb through the hatch. His spacesuit had expanded and become almost rigid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNear the end of my walk,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told the New York Times magazine in 1994, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI realized that my feet had pulled out of my shoes and my hands had pulled away from my gloves. My entire suit stretched so much that my hands and feet appeared to shrink.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe decided that his only option was to open a valve to release air from inside his spacesuit. It deflated enough to allow Mr. Leonov to enter the capsule\\xe2\\x80\\x99s air lock headfirst, but the change in pressure left him at risk of decompression sickness. His spacewalk lasted only 12 minutes, but his body temperature had risen so much that sweat was sloshing in the leggings of his spacesuit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t report this down to Earth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Leonov said in 1999. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI knew the situation better than anyone else.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be decades before the dangers he encountered were fully known. Mr. Leonov also revealed, years later, that he had a suicide pill in his helmet, in case he could not return to the spacecraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce he was back inside the capsule, it began to roll uncontrollably. Oxygen levels in the cabin became dangerously high, but eventually the cosmonauts were able to stabilize the craft for its return to Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the automated reentry system failed, Mr. Leonov and Belyayev flew their craft manually, tumbling wildly until its parachutes opened. They came to rest in a dense forest in the Ural Mountains, about 1,000 miles from their intended landing spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurrounded by several feet of snow, the two cosmonauts stayed in the capsule as temperatures fell below zero. It took more than two days before they were rescued by helicopter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis feat made Mr. Leonov a national hero, and he was expected to be the first person from his country to walk on the moon. Before the United States could do so, Soviet spaceships circled the moon and landed on its surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut other test flights failed, and the booster rocket designed to propel the Soviets\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lunar mission exploded on the launchpad. The space race was won by the United States, culminating in the Apollo 11 mission, which touched down on July 20, 1969, accompanied by astronaut Neil Armstrong\\xe2\\x80\\x99s memorable words as he stepped onto the moon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Sea of Tranquility: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlexei Arkhipovich Leonov was born May 30, 1934, in the Siberian village of Listvyanka. He was from a large family, and his father, a onetime coal miner and farmer, spent time in a Soviet gulag for dissent.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung Alexei was transfixed by aviation from an early age and also studied art. He entered the Soviet air force in 1953 and trained as a fighter pilot and parachutist.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 1969, Mr. Leonov was in a motorcade entering the Kremlin when a man wearing a police uniform opened fire with two automatic handguns. Mr. Leonov\\xe2\\x80\\x99s limousine was struck by more than a dozen shots, apparently intended for Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, who was in a different car. Mr. Leonov\\xe2\\x80\\x99s driver was killed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI looked down and saw two bullet holes on each side of my coat where the bullets had passed through,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Leonov said in 1994. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA fifth bullet passed so close to my face I could feel it go by.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1975, Mr. Leonov returned to space as part of the first joint U.S.-Soviet space effort. His capsule docked with an Apollo spacecraft under the command of NASA astronaut Thomas P. Stafford. They shook hands through a connecting portal and became close friends.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the eyes of all of humanity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Leonov said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe showed the best side of man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSurvivors include his wife, Svetlana, two daughters and several grandchildren.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Leonov became director of the Soviet cosmonaut corps and retired in 1992. He later worked in banking and exhibited his paintings worldwide, including at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\nFluent in English and fond of jokes, he was a popular speaker at gatherings of space aficionados. Author Arthur C. Clarke named a spacecraft after Mr. Leonov in his 1982 novel, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c2010,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a sequel to \\xe2\\x80\\x9c2001: A Space Odyssey.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Leonov came to regret the secrecy and suspicion surrounding the Cold War competition in space.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf we could have gotten together earlier,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said in 1990, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe would already have built an international observatory on the moon and we would be flying to Mars right now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Soviet spacecraft obtained lunar soil samples before Apollo 11 reached the moon in 1969. The soil samples were obtained by the Soviet Union in 1970.'\n",

His mother, a homemaker, instilled in her son a love of books and artwork.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gerstein studied at the Chouinard Art Institute in California, now part of the California Institute of the Arts, before beginning his animation career in Los Angeles and then New York. He did film, television and commercial work before making his first foray into children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s literature in the 1970s as the illustrator of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomething Queer Is Going On\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mystery series by writer Elizabeth Levy, with whom he worked for decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began to illustrate his own works in the 1980s, beginning with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cArnold of the Ducks,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a story about a boy taken in and raised by ducks. In an early display of Mr. Gerstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s whimsy, the boy is returned to his family by a kite, although the quacking of ducks will always exert a pull on his heart. Mr. Gerstein said the manuscript was rejected seven times before it was published in 1983.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis other books included \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTales of Pan\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (1986), \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNoah and the Great Flood\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (1999) and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe White Ram: A Story of Abraham and Isaac\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (2006).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat Charlie Heard\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (2002), he said he sought to help children see sound \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as well as silence \\xe2\\x80\\x94 on the page in his account of the life of the American modernist composer Charles Ives. His picture book \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Wild Boy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d selected by the New York Times as one of the best illustrated books of 1998, as well as the young-adult novel \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVictor\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (also 1998), were based on the true story of a feral boy who emerged from the woods of southern France in the winter of 1800 and was civilized \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to a degree \\xe2\\x80\\x94 by a young doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m always looking for things that puzzle and disturb or amuse me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he once said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI make books for people, most of whom happen to be children, and I try to address the most essential parts of all of us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gerstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s marriage to Sandra MacDonald ended in divorce. Their son Jesse Gerstein died in 1991. Survivors include his wife of 35 years, Susan Yard Harris of Westhampton; a son from his first marriage, Aram Gerstein of San Francisco; a daughter from his second marriage, Risa Harris-Gerstein of Brooklyn; a brother; two grandchildren; and a great-grandson.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs time passed after the publication of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Man Who Walked Between the Towers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the book gathered new young readers, with new grown-ups to guide them through the story. Instead of parents who had turned off the TV to spare their children the news footage of airplanes tearing through skyscrapers, there were parents who had seen those images when they were young, and their own children, who would know 9/11 only as an event in history.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost a fairy tale,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Gerstein told the Globe, speaking of his book. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a way to restore the towers to children whose only image of them is on fire. It shows them in another context \\xe2\\x80\\x94 how big they were, and the space between them. I resurrect them in the mind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d'\n",

      "b'Two certainties about the NFL are that nothing stays the same for long and nothing is easy. One minute, the Rams were opening as a favorite in the Super Bowl, and every franchise with an opening wanted to copy their head coach. The next, they were surrender-punting their way into a muddle of NFC teams already in a scuffle for playoff contention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 49ers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fortunes have flipped just as radically. An also-ran all of last season after losing quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo to injury, the 49ers now stand atop the NFC and look every bit the part of burgeoning power. The Rams had started to fall off the mountaintop before Sunday, but the 49ers shoved them and claimed their spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 49ers validated their Monday night shellacking of the Cleveland Browns and cemented themselves as a legitimate Super Bowl contender. They are the NFC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lone unbeaten team, and now their 5-0 record includes a convincing victory over the defending conference champions. Kyle Shanahan has wrested the mantle of trendiest play-calling head coach from McVay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe way Shanahan wields his running attack is sublime, but the 49ers have thrived on defense. They are simply suffocating opponents. Their years of cratering allowed them to collect a defensive line with four first-round draft picks, three of whom were selected in the top seven: Armstead, DeForest Buckner, Solomon Thomas and rookie Nick Bosa, who on Sunday repeatedly steamrolled Andrew Whitworth, one of the best left tackles in football.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe combination of the 49ers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 marauding defense and Shanahan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s relentless running game has worn down opponents. Do you want to see the effect of great coaching? San Francisco has outscored opponents, 86-31, in the second half, and it has not allowed a point in the second half in its past three games.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 49ers, we know, are legit. But what of the Rams? The long-term smart money is that McVay will figure out their problems, even if they do run deep. Whether he can solve them soon enough in the rough-and-tumble NFC to make the playoffs, let alone defend their conference title, is a different question.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rams spent the past two seasons climbing to the top of the NFL and reshaping it in their image. They were both powerhouse and template.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut since they beat the New Orleans Saints in the NFC championship game, McVay\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Rams \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the team with the unstoppable offense, cutting-edge roster and newly extended franchise quarterback \\xe2\\x80\\x94 are 3-4. If the playoffs started today, the Rams wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be in them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some ways, the Rams are experiencing standard life in the NFL. The other teams\\xe2\\x80\\x99 coaches live in big houses, too, and once a team finds success, opponents will find ways to attack it. Even great teams can take time to figure themselves out. The Patriots last year were 1-2 with resounding losses to the Jacksonville Jaguars and Detroit Lions. This seems like treacherous territory for the Rams. Really, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the inevitable struggle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Rams\\xe2\\x80\\x99 problems cannot be dismissed as a Super Bowl hangover. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re more concrete than that.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcVay has been forced to reinvent the Rams\\xe2\\x80\\x99 offense on the fly. Last season, they ran almost every play out of the same personnel grouping \\xe2\\x80\\x94 one tight end, one running back and three wide receivers. They played offense like Greg Maddux pitched. Everything looked the same until you had to react, and then the result left you confused and defeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nBut several interlocking factors have stymied McVay\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approach. The rushing attack that bludgeoned opponents has been diminished by Todd Gurley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s knee problems. He cannot carry the same load as he did last year, and when he does play, he is not as quick or as powerful.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoff thrived on play-action passes last season. With Gurley a shell of his best self, it seems evident Gurley propped up Goff, and without him Goff has been exposed. Whether that exposure is temporary or permanent is only the most important question hanging over the Rams, who signed Goff to a four-year, $134 million contract extension just before the season.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nSunday was the ugly nadir of a tough season for Goff. He completed 13 of 24 passes for 78 yards. The 49ers harassed him all day, and the fact he took four sacks is actually testament to how well he got rid of the ball. But there can be no excuse for any quarterback throwing for 3.3 yards per attempt, let alone one installed as a clear franchise caretaker.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nGoff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contract has already had an effect on how much talent the Rams can put around him. The Rams let guard Rodger Saffold walk this offseason in free agency, and his departure has had a more significant impact than many expected. When Gurley sat out, the Rams turned to Malcolm Brown, who is not even a close approximation. The Rams loved third-round draft pick Darrell Henderson coming out of the draft, but he has contributed essentially nothing and fumbled in a key spot Sunday.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Gurley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s health has stifled his production, the rest of the league has finally started to find solutions. By playing a six-man front during the Super Bowl with a fluid combination of zone coverages behind it, the Patriots showed the best way to slow down the Rams. Every team has its own tweaks, but that is the blueprint.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nMcVay is a gifted play-caller and brilliant offensive mind, not just a coach who came up with a good scheme and has no Plan B. McVay probably will find the right countermoves to how the league has countered him. The Rams have no reason to worry that the league has caught up to McVay, because eventually he will surge back ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, though, the NFC is a viper pit, and the next 10 games will be a battle for the Rams to defend their NFC title.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rams entered Sunday with rare urgency for a 3-2 team headed into Week 6. The NFC is loaded with viable wild-card contenders, and Seattle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s victory in Cleveland further cemented the NFC West as the NFL\\xe2\\x80\\x99s toughest division. No matter what, the Rams would have left the game in third place in the division. They are now two games behind Seattle and 2\\xc2\\xbd behind the 49ers. The loss dropped them behind the Minnesota Vikings, Seahawks and Carolina Panthers in the wild-card race, outside the playoff picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nWith their next three games against the Atlanta Falcons, Cincinnati Bengals and Pittsburgh Steelers, the Rams have an opportunity to right what is haywire with their offense and solidify their shaky status in the playoff hunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nBy Thanksgiving, the Rams\\xe2\\x80\\x99 current struggles may seem like an old story. But they will still have to contend with the 49ers. In the NFL, power can change hands fast. The 49ers have it in the NFC West, and the Rams do not.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more on the NFL:\\r\\n\\r\\nAD'\n",

Sandys/The Washington Post)\\r\\n\\r\\nA look at the good (Hail!) and bad (Fail!) from the Redskins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 17-16 win over the Dolphins on Sunday.\\r\\n\\r\\nHail: Scary Terry\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still looking for a Halloween costume idea, consider a Terry McLaurin Redskins jersey. The rookie wide receiver continues to be a nightmare for NFL defenses. Dolphins rookie cornerback Ken Webster made his first career start after Pro Bowl cornerback Xavien Howard was ruled out against Washington, and he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stand a chance against McLaurin. The Redskins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 third-round pick finished with four catches for 100 yards, including his fourth and fifth touchdown grabs of the season. McLaurin had a rare drop early in the fourth quarter, but he made up for it later, hauling in a 32-yard catch that enabled Washington to get out of the shadow of its own end zone and burn some clock while protected a seven-point lead. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to take full credit for the Scary Terry nickname,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Redskins quarterback Case Keenum told reporters after the game. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t patent it or anything, but maybe you guys can go back in the archives and look who said it first.

Washington went three-and-out on its first three possessions and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t record a first down until its first play of the second quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHail: Shaun Dion Hamilton\\r\\n\\r\\nSafety Landon Collins had the best game for the Redskins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 defense, with 12 tackles, two passes defended, a sack, a forced fumble and a near interception, but Hamilton was responsible for the best play. Midway through the third quarter, after the Redskins took a 14-3 lead on McLaurin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second touchdown catch, Hamilton anticipated a Josh Rosen pass intended for wide receiver Isaiah Ford and made a diving interception. The pick, which was more impressive than any of Washington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 13 receptions, was the Redskins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 second of the day and seventh of the season. The team had 15 interceptions all of last year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s one hell of a catch by Shaun Dion Hamilton for the interception.#Redskins pic.twitter.com/39ix2cRv4z \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Chad Ryan (@ChadwikoRCC) October 13, 2019\\r\\n\\r\\nFail: Tanking For Tua\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two types of Redskins fans: Those who look at Sunday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s result, coupled with the Cowboys\\xe2\\x80\\x99 surprising loss to the Jets, and think, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWow, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re only two games out of the NFC East lead,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and those who look at Sunday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s result, coupled with the Bengals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 expected loss to the Ravens and think, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDarn, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re now a game out of the lead for the No. 1 pick.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in the latter camp, Sunday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s win felt more like a loss.\\r\\n\\r\\nTua Tagovailoa just felt a sudden urge to register for his fall 2020 classes. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Adam Kilgore (@AdamKilgoreWP) October 13, 2019\\r\\n\\r\\nHail: Adrian Peterson\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 34-year-old running back proved he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still got it, at least against the league\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worst rushing defense. Peterson finished with 23 carries for 118 yards, 60 of which came on one touchdown drive in the second quarter. Interim Coach Bill Callahan said last week that the Redskins would look to establish the run against the Dolphins, and Peterson did his part to make that game plan look smart. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI take my hat off to the offensive line and receivers, they did a great job, tight ends they played outstanding and really got this offensive running game going,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peterson told NFL Network\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Deion Sanders after his best game of the season. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we needed, man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat shot by Fox here.

Washington should consider itself lucky that a deal never came to fruition. After Arizona drafted Kyler Murray with the No. 1 pick this year, Rosen was dealt to the Dolphins. Coach Brian Flores said last week that Rosen, the No. 10 overall pick in the 2018 draft, would be his team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s starter for the remainder of the season, and if Miami\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goal is to finish 0-16, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a better man for the job. Rosen was dreadful on Sunday, completing 15 of 25 passes for 85 yards and throwing two interceptions. By the fourth quarter, Flores decided he had seen enough, and benched Rosen in favor of Ryan Fitzpatrick. Afterward, Flores said Rosen will continue to start, but that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily mean he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll finish. Asked whether he thought his coach was going back on his promise, Rosen replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s above my pay grade.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHail: Redskins Fans in Miami\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 76-year-old Redskins who paid $1,600 to fly a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFire Bruce Allen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d banner over Hard Rock Stadium for two hours before Sunday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s game told me there was almost as much burgundy and gold in the stands as aqua and orange.

      "b'I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure whether it qualifies as comforting to realize, in nail-gnawing victory, that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re even closer to absolute misery than imagined. The Dolphins, who have traded away their best players over the past six weeks, aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really trying to win. Consider them effortlessly terrible. The Redskins, on the other hand, exerted themselves quite a bit in losing their first five games. Consider them diligently terrible. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to know which is better (or worse): To execute a cockamamie losing plan, or to stumble into hopelessness?\\r\\n\\r\\nDecide for yourself. But in a 17-16 victory Sunday, Washington survived the humiliation of falling to an opponent that probably would have shed tears during the postgame prayer circle if it had won. To end a week that started with the firing of Coach Jay Gruden, Washington improved to 1-5 in this lost season. Miami, which hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come within 20 points of victory in its previous four games, actually improved its record, too. At 0-5, it plods on a long journey toward clinching the No. 1 pick in the 2020 draft.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February, Hard Rock Stadium will host Super Bowl LIV. So, clearly, this game was an odd form of pre-Super Bowl hazing. The Dolphins announced that 59,808 tickets were distributed Sunday, but 20,000 of those must have been thrown directly into trash cans. It was a bland atmosphere befitting two winless teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the most part, the game lived down to expectations. The first six possessions resulted in punts. Washington gained just 311 yards, Miami just 271. But there were enough splashes of good football to keep it interesting. Washington rookie wide receiver Terry McLaurin was spectacular again, finishing with 100 yards on four receptions. As fantastic as those stats were, his impact was greater. He scored two long touchdowns. If Washington had been able to finish the game properly on offense, his 32-yard reception with 3:59 remaining would have resonated as an even bigger play.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut after all the misfortune to start the 2019 season, the Redskins weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to win without some drama. They led 17-3 entering the fourth quarter, but Miami replaced ineffective and battered quarterback Josh Rosen with Ryan Fitzpatrick. And he turned into FitzMagic one more time, throwing for 132 yards in the final quarter and leading the Dolphins on two touchdown drives.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Fitzgerald threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to DeVante Parker with six seconds remaining, Miami Coach Brian Flores didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to settle for a game-tying extra point. He went for two, and the play had no chance. Washington snuffed out a screen pass to Kenyan Drake, who dropped the ball. And just like that, it was over. The game had gone from awful to one-sided to thrilling, but thank heavens, it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t advance to overtime.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be fair, the tankin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Dolphins went for it when they realized they could win this game. They executed a fake punt. They tried an onside kick. Instead of extending the game, they went for the win at the end, which is a questionable decision to make at home, especially considering Miami had the momentum of a hot quarterback. It was also a merciful decision. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only so much of this game that anyone \\xe2\\x80\\x94 coaches included \\xe2\\x80\\x94 should be subjected to.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really interesting when you have two winless teams,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bill Callahan, the interim Washington head coach. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEverybody pulls out all the stops.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the two-point attempt, Flores said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were trying to win the game, pretty much. We talked about it. We felt good about the play. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something we worked on all week.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Washington sideline, McLaurin remembered feeling confident when he saw Drake go in motion. The defense had been preparing all week for what the Dolphins do out of that formation. Safety Landon Collins, who had his best game so far in Washington, said the defense knew the Dolphins had only two options in that situation: throw to Parker or a screen to Drake. Even if Drake had caught the pass, he would have been stopped easily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA breath of fresh air,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cornerback Josh Norman said of the win. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re headed in the right direction. We have a long way to go, but it feels good to get that win.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pessimist, or maybe even the realist, in you will declare that this accomplishment is merely one notch above the worst-case, cancel-the-season-right-now outcome. A loss to the Dolphins would have been devastating because, even as the team fell apart and fired Gruden, it still didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it was irredeemable. During his clumsy and tone-deaf news conference last Monday, team president Bruce Allen lauded the team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s young talent and made the instantly infamous remark, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe culture is actually damn good.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the results, the Redskins didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think they were 0-5 bad. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still not of the mind-set that they are 4-12 or worse. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still on that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe are close\\xe2\\x80\\x9d vibe. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foolish, but that is what they believe. So a loss Sunday \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which would have triggered debates about whether 0-16 was possible \\xe2\\x80\\x94 would have forced them to rethink everything. It might have ensured Callahan would have no chance of salvaging this season. Actually, when you lay it all out, perhaps a humiliating defeat would have been better for an organization burdened by disturbing levels of arrogance at the top.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey will have to settle for being almost a complete disaster. They are not the worst team in the NFL, but they are still the definitive second-worst squad right now.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a week for D.C. sports, huh? The Mystics won their first WNBA title. The Nationals are two wins from appearing in their first World Series. And the Redskins finally found a team more pitiful than they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not jumping for joy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d defensive end Jonathan Allen said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe won. We were supposed to win.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Blooper Bowl presented a challenge to the notion of what Washington is \\xe2\\x80\\x9csupposed to\\xe2\\x80\\x9d do. Perhaps a proud player cannot find great joy in winning a game like this, but without question, there is relief.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more on the Washington Redskins:\\r\\n\\r\\nAD'\n",

      "b'Despite his frustration, the ever-calm McLaurin soon made up for his mistake. After Miami downed a punt at the Washington 1-yard line, the Redskins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 offense found itself in the shadow of its own end zone with 4:41 left. McLaurin ran a post-corner route to get open for a 32-yard catch that moved the chains and provided valuable breathing room in a game Washington held on to win.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI just wanted to make up for the one I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d McLaurin said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what you want as a receiver. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not necessarily going to make them all, but I try to train my mind to really let things go when things don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily go my way and be ready for the next play. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s humbling, because you come from having a great game to dropping a ball that could really continue our drive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMcLaurin added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think [route running] is what separates good receivers from great receivers. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not saying I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m great yet, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m striving to be.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA third-round pick in April\\xe2\\x80\\x99s draft, McLaurin has grown into the top offensive weapon on Washington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s roster, and the Redskins fed him the ball Sunday. He had seven targets, three more than any teammate, finishing with four catches for 100 yards and two touchdowns. The first score was a 25-yarder in which McLaurin ran inside before breaking to the outside, leaving Miami defensive back Ken Webster chasing after him. The second touchdown was a 33-yard fade from the slot in which McLaurin simply ran away from the defender.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impressive the type of poise that he has,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d interim coach Bill Callahan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe [fourth-quarter reception] was an art-form piece of work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Redskins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 offense has had trouble producing big plays since last season, and McLaurin has been a pleasant surprise as a home run hitter. He has at least 50 yards receiving in every game he has played and a touchdown in all but one. For a team that is lacking high-end players on its roster, McLaurin has established himself as a building block at wide receiver.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friendly on the eyes, as a quarterback,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Keenum said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust the body language he gives in and out of breaks. I know where he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be at all times.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nRun game finds success, but quarterback play is still an issue\\r\\n\\r\\nCallahan swore that the Redskins would rededicate themselves to the run under his direction, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exactly what they did in his first game in charge. Running back Adrian Peterson got work early and often and came away with season highs in attempts (23) and yards (118). His 25-yarder in the second quarter was his longest run of the year and set up the first touchdown.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is exactly what Callahan wants: more rushing attempts than the opponent. Washington had 33 rushes compared to Miami\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 21.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was happy for [Peterson] to see that we could get him going and get him in a rhythm,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Callahan said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou see the competitive nature of him. He would take the ball every down if we gave it to him and he would produce.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while the commitment to the running game is real, quarterback play remains an issue. Callahan said he saw enough from Keenum that he would continue being the starting quarterback moving forward, but the numbers weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t great. He finished 13 for 25 for 166 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions \\xe2\\x80\\x94 although he came dangerously close to one on a play in which he scrambled in the second half. Keenum also continued to miss some open receivers, but the big throws he made to McLaurin were perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe passing game probably will continue to be a work in progress, and some will continue to call for rookie Dwayne Haskins to start, but the success of the running game \\xe2\\x80\\x94 albeit against a struggling Dolphins defense \\xe2\\x80\\x94 offered some hope. If Washington can run the ball effectively and take advantage of some play-action fakes and one-on-one coverages, that could be a recipe for success.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuinton Dunbar is Washington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best cornerback\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nJosh Norman gets more attention and the bigger paycheck, but Dunbar continues to prove he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the top cornerback on the Redskins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 roster. He recorded an interception against Miami when he jumped a route in the second quarter, his third in four games played.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe defense visibly suffered over the past two years when he missed time with injuries, and opponents have tested Norman more than him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust film breakdown,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dunbar said of his recent success. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReading concepts. Me playing receiver [previously] helps me out a lot with concepts and stuff like that. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty much it. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Now that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m four years, five years in, I slow the game down tremendously.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD'\n",

Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we know so far.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x97\\x8fSyrian government troops have moved back into towns in northeastern Syria for the first time in years after U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters, in a stunning reversal, reached a deal with the government.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x97\\x8fTurkish-backed rebels have announced the start of a military operation to retake the northern city of Manbij, which has long been a flash point.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x97\\x8fHundreds of Islamic State family members have escaped a detention camp in Ain Issa, which has been the administrative capital of the Kurdish-led government in northeastern Syria.\\r\\n\\r\\nForces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad took up positions Monday in several key towns across northeastern Syria, state media and a war monitoring group reported, following a dramatic 11th-hour deal with local Kurdish fighters to ward off a Turkish assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time in years, Syrian troops deployed to Tabqa, on the outskirts of Raqqa, and to the headquarters of the Kurdish-led administration in Ain Issa, about 20 miles from the Turkish border.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut even as the Syrian government and Kurdish-led forces hashed out the details of their agreement, Turkish-backed Syrian rebels separately announced the start of an operation to retake the northern city of Manbij, where U.S. troops had been stationed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hinted earlier Monday at a broadening of Turkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offensive, which began last week. He said Turkey was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin the process of implementing our decision on the subject of Manbij,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a Syrian town about 25 miles west of the Euphrates River.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTurkey had long demanded that the United States expel Kurdish fighters from the town and complained that a deal struck with Washington to remove the fighters was not being implemented.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurkish officials view the Kurdish fighters \\xe2\\x80\\x94 known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as terrorists for their links to the Kurdistan Workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Party, or PKK, which has waged a decades-long war for autonomy inside Turkey.

      "b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEventually I woke up and looked at the score and thought, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, my God, what happened?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ansley, Rendon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s childhood coach, remembered Thursday. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd then it was, \\xe2\\x80\\x98What did Anthony do?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAnsley pulled the highlights up on his phone. As it turned out \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as it often turns out for Washington \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Rendon did a lot. He scored the Nationals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 first run after doubling in the sixth. He hit the first of back-to-back solo homers off Clayton Kershaw in the eighth as Washington tied the score at 3. Then he revved a 10th-inning rally with a scorched double that stuck in the padding of the left field wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone will remember the ending, the Howie Kendrick grand slam, the moment that pushed Washington into an NLCS that it now leads 2-0. But Rendon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bat made the win possible. He has followed with two hits and three walks against the St. Louis Cardinals. The country is finally seeing a superstar. Ansley just sees a small kid grown up.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has, after all, seen Rendon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s swing before. He has seen the muted stance. He has seen Rendon lift his front foot in the middle of the pitcher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s windup, no more than an inch off the ground, before dropping it as if the dirt is an eggshell he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t break. Rendon learned it all from Ansley, when he was just a 9-year-old in Houston, and he has made only subtle changes since. His hands are a little lower while he waits to hit. His front leg is opened up a bit more this season.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from that, details only Ansley and trained hitting coaches can spot, Rendon has stayed the same. The key to the 29-year-old\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offensive success is that he gets ready early. Or, as Nationals hitting coach Kevin Long puts it, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe thing with Anthony is that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s never, ever late.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA lot of guys have that big leg kick, they are loading late and trying to time the pitcher, but I could never do that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rendon said of his approach. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor me, it was always really simple: Get your foot up, get it down in the same spot, do it all before the pitcher is releasing the ball, and that way you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re ready for anything. Then all you have to do is hit the ball.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRendon laughed at that last part. He knows that hitting 98-mph heat, or sharp breaking balls, is so far from easy. He just has a habit of making it look that way. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really the root of what he does at the plate: He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s relaxed. He removes as many variables as possible. He gives himself every opportunity to adjust.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nHe often shrugs off questions about his swing or success at the plate, about the 34 home runs, 44 doubles, league-leading 126 RBI and 1.010 on-base-plus-slugging percentage that made him an MVP candidate this season. His swing has made him the heartbeat of the Nationals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 order and, soon, one of baseball\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most sought-after free agents. (Washington offered him a seven-year contract in the range of $210 million to $215 million in early September, but that is not expected to keep Rendon from exploring the market this offseason.) It also has made him one of a few reasons to believe Washington could beat the Cardinals in the NLCS \\xe2\\x80\\x94 just two more wins now \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and advance to the World Series.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nRendon, though, would rather explain it all with basic cliches. He says he just does the same thing every time. He says he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just trying to hit it where the defense isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t playing. He even suggested recently that his career-best season was largely a product of luck.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there is science to the simplicity. It started when Rendon signed up for the Houston Thunder and Ansley became his coach. Ansley, who was in the Houston Astros\\xe2\\x80\\x99 organization in the early 1990s, took interest in how naturally Rendon used his wrists. Most kids didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know to snap them while making contact. Rendon did, before any real coaching, and that gave Ansley a good starting point. Ansley had a drill that put a metal pole behind Rendon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s back leg to force him to keep his swing tight. If Rendon didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go straight to the ball, he would smack the pole and a loud sound would ring in his ear. It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take long before he was taking cuts as if the pole wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t there.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was sort of like playing a video game, even when he was that young,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ansley, who still coaches and works for a Houston-area school district. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou could tell him to do something, and he was so coordinated that he figured it out right away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nHe taught Rendon to be a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno-stride\\xe2\\x80\\x9d hitter \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the term for lifting your front foot and putting it down in the same spot \\xe2\\x80\\x94 because he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to complicate hitting. He figured Rendon may add a leg kick or other flares when he got to high school or college, but Rendon never did. He stuck to the understated movement because it made him feel ahead of the pitcher. If his hands and weight are set before the pitch is released, he is ready for high velocity and can react to off-speed. That hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t changed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnsley remembers one summer tournament, 15 years ago, when he accused a teenage Rendon of trying too hard to blast homers. Rendon hit a bunch of pop flies to the warning track. Rendon denied it, smiling at Ansley, telling him that he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t doing anything differently. But a confession arrived at another showcase the next weekend. Rendon went 14 for 14 across a handful of games on all line-drive singles and doubles. He heard Ansley and, without a word, proved that he could hit however he wanted. Ansley recalled leaning over to another coach and saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll ever get out again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that same thought is passed around by Rendon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coaches and teammates with the Nationals. Rendon is the same human metronome, his knees dipping into a crouch as the pitcher winds up, then his chest-high hands whipping so fast that his swing is a blur. Then he still doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have much to say about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tweaks are hardly noticeable from year to year. He lowered his hands last season to turn more grounders into line drives. He opened his stance this season, by just a few inches, to add power by giving his hips a chance to make a full turn during each swing. It led to a career high in home runs and his highest slugging percentage. It was evident Wednesday, when he ripped almost every pitch he swung at, when his calmness in big moments pushed the Nationals to a place they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never been. And it makes it easy to wonder what Rendon could do next.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf everyone was capable, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d use him as a template for how to hit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Long said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only one Anthony Rendon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more on the Nationals:\\r\\n\\r\\nAD'\n",

      "b'LeCroy had waited to do this. He spent the early days of Taylor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tenure with Harrisburg gauging how the former everyday major leaguer was handling the demotion. After four or five games, he recognized the 28-year-old\\xe2\\x80\\x99s confidence was shaken.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou could sense it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d LeCroy said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a bad attitude, but he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nLeCroy called Jonathan Tosches, the Nationals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 manager of advance scouting, and asked him to put together a highlight video. He wanted to pump Taylor up, show him the player he could be. Maybe this would lead him to return to the hitter he had been at times throughout his career. LeCroy pressed play.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nTaylor transformed on the video. He smacked doubles down the lines and in the gaps. He blasted home runs everywhere. He swiped bases with abandon. There he was, in Game 4 of the 2017 National League Division Series, belting a grand slam. The screen went dark. LeCroy handed Taylor a thumb drive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI really appreciate them doing that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Taylor said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey were great at helping me remember [the player I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been] and also move forward.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThree months later, what Taylor puzzled out in Harrisburg proved pivotal. His contributions when called upon, as a surprise pinch hitter and as the center fielder after a right hamstring strain sidelined starter Victor Robles, have played a sizable role in the Nationals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 postseason run. He has still struggled at times with the bat, and his defensive miscue in Game 2 of the NL Championship Series could have ended up being costlier than it was, but he has given the Nationals what they needed. He have the team space to not rush Robles back.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good chance the 22-year-old Robles is back this week, maybe as soon as Monday. Taylor will then return to his usual roles of pinch runner and defensive replacement. It would fit in a season of ups and downs, and it would give the Nationals a seasoned bench option to use against the St. Louis Cardinals in a series they lead 2-0.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been unbelievable since he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s come back up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Manager Dave Martinez said of Taylor. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe understands his role. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been really good at it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything changed in Harrisburg. Taylor worked with Rupp to shorten his swing again and keep the barrel of his bat in the strike zone longer. He continued analyzing pitchers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pickoff moves to hone the base-stealing approach he might need later. He shagged flyballs and threw to the bases from center and right field before games because General Manager Mike Rizzo wanted him ready if they needed him to replace an injured outfielder or serve as a defensive replacement for the playoffs. (Or, as it turns out, both.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hitting still came slowly. His batting average hovered between .220 and .240, and he still didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel comfortable at the plate. LeCroy remembered a late July game in Portland, Maine, when he thought things might change. Taylor drove a 3-0, \\xe2\\x80\\x9creally good fastball\\xe2\\x80\\x9d over the fence in center, his third home run in a week. But then he struck out at least once in 15 of the next 16 games, and his batting average sank again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe advantage of major league players playing in the minors is that they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about stats. Taylor disregarded his numbers, something he looked at in the majors, and searched instead for the rhythm every hitter craves. But by late August, Taylor felt no better. Then, for reasons he still can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t explain, he felt good again two weeks before the Senators\\xe2\\x80\\x99 season ended. He went 3 for 5 one night, collected six more hits in the next three games and polished off the week by going 4 for 4 with four doubles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was finally able to get that feeling,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Taylor said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI just tried to repeat over and over.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe executed toward the end of the regular season, when the Nationals sewed up a postseason berth and he played consistently. He sprayed three extra-base hits in his last six at-bats of the regular season. The performance emboldened Martinez to use Taylor \\xe2\\x80\\x94 off the team because of his bat three months earlier \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as a pinch hitter in the biggest moment of the season. Milwaukee Brewers super-reliever Josh Hader plunked Taylor in the eighth inning of the NL wild-card game, a hit by pitch that ultimately sparked the game-winning rally.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nationals needed him later when, in Game 2 of the NLDS, Robles departed in the eighth inning with a mild right hamstring strain. Taylor stepped forward again to replace an injured outfielder and become the Nationals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 starting center fielder.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has contributed in myriad ways since, small things such as singling to flip the lineup over the pitcher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spot in Game 4 of the NLDS. The next inning, Ryan Zimmerman drilled a home run to break the game open. He has done big things, too, such as his difficult, diving catch in center to secure the last out of Game 5 in the NLDS to beat the juggernaut Los Angeles Dodgers. His home run in Game 2 of the NLCS against the Cardinals gave starter Max Scherzer a small early lead on a day when that was all he needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night, a reporter asked Taylor about his homer. The outfielder misunderstood and thought he meant the line drive that flew by him in the eighth inning. He laughed and explained he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear the ball make contact, which made it more difficult to judge. The homer, he added, surprised him. Flyballs hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t carried in Busch Stadium until his, when what once looked lost seemed important again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure quite how high it was going to go,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Taylor said.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\\r\\n\\r\\nAD'\n",

The 26-year-old has shared a wealth of fuzzy rock tracks through different media, but they are all defined by his knack for concise melodies that have a tendency to loop in your head and his skillful guitar stylings. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHouse of Sugar,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from the musician born Alexander Giannascoli, might offer the most vivid and inviting entry point yet into the world of (Sandy) Alex G. Some of the songs are intentionally a little muddled to add mystery, but Giannascoli\\xe2\\x80\\x99s instrumentation and voice have never come through clearer to paint a portrait of one of the decade\\xe2\\x80\\x99s defining indie rock artists. 7:30 p.m. $20-$25.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiddleburg Film Festival at various locations: Washington cinephiles have no shortage of film festivals, with a busy annual schedule that includes FilmFest DC, AFI Docs, DC Shorts, the Washington Jewish Film Festival, the Environmental Film Festival and the March on Washington Film Festival competing for attention. Yet the seven-year-old Middleburg Film Festival, held in a quiet horse-country town that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a dedicated movie theater, has become an important stop on the national festival circuit: Emma Stone introduced a screening of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLa La Land\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in 2016, and Viggo Mortensen and Peter Farrelly hosted a Q&A last year after \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreen Book\\xe2\\x80\\x9d won the Audience Award.

Starting Oct. 18, in celebration of the album\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 20th anniversary, fans and record collectors will be able to get their hands on Monch\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fiery opus. D.C. rapheads will get a bonus when the 46-year-old emcee comes to the Kennedy Center to talk about the making of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInternal Affairs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on Wednesday (7 p.m., $15) followed by a front-to-back performance of the album on Thursday. 7:30 p.m. $35.\\r\\n\\r\\nChurchKey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 10th Anniversary Celebration, featuring Allagash: No bar has been as important to the craft beer movement over the past decade as ChurchKey. Its long, ambitious beer menus and star-studded tap takeovers have played a part in landing ChurchKey on numerous \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBest American Beer Bars\\xe2\\x80\\x9d lists, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also the not-so-obvious things \\xe2\\x80\\x94 temperature controls for different beer styles, intensive staff training, the use of proper glassware \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that keep ChurchKey at the top of its game. Hike up those worn metal stairs again on Thursday as ChurchKey continues its 10th anniversary celebrations with a special event featuring Allagash owner Rob Todd and Allagash brewer Jason Perkins, who are bringing 40 of their Belgian-style ales. Of particular note is the Cloister, a special blend of Allagash White, wild-fermented coolship beer and a wood-aged saison created just for ChurchKey. 4 p.m. Free; beers priced individually.\\r\\n\\r\\nRosslyn Cider Fest at Gateway Park: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard cider season in the Mid-Atlantic, with cideries hosting festivals nearly every weekend.

Defiance. (The Irish pub staple Strongbow will also be served.) Admission is free, but $15 gets 10 tickets for cider tastings. Beyond drinks, there will be food trucks, including Swizzler and Mama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Donut Bites, and live music from Justin Trawick and the Common Good. 4 to 8 p.m. Free; cider tasting $15.\\r\\n\\r\\nFriday, Oct. 18\\r\\n\\r\\n29Rooms at D.C.

In space, a.k.a. cable television, Hodgson survived a barrage of cheesy movies by \\xe2\\x80\\x9criffing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on them mercilessly with two robot friends, and a new art form was born. This weekend, Hodgson, 59, will sport the red jumpsuit for the first time since 1993 and bring a live version of the MST3K format familiar to fans: making fun of bad movies \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in this case, the British schlockfest \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCircus of Horrors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (1960) and the 1986 kung fu flick \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo Retreat, No Surrender\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 interspersed with sketches.

(Whenever you read about gut bacteria or probiotics? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ghannoum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work.)\\r\\n\\r\\nGhannoum was in Washington for a scientific conference in 1990, and he was in trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis country, Kuwait, had just been invaded by Saddam Hussein. His city was in scorched-earth ruin, and his young family was squatting in a dorm room in England while he tried to find work and a way to get them all to the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the people who could help him find work wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be in the District until the next weekend. He had neither the money to stay there, nor the means to change his plane ticket.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he ducked into a travel agency and told his story.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe travel agent in charge that day listened to this story from this Muslim man with a mustache, a thick accent and a brown suit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t turn him away.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found a way for Ghannoum to be in D.C. the following weekend, with some keyboard clicks and a new plane ticket. And then he opened his wallet and gave him $80 cash. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo you have some spending money,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told him.\\r\\n\\r\\nGhannoum interviewed like a boss and got two job offers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nHe told the story about America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s open arms for 30 years as he wrote papers, made discoveries and became a force in American science.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he also never got to thank the man. The travel agency began laying off employees and closed for good not long after Ghannoum settled in America, during the 1991 recession.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo last month, Ghannoum and his son posted something on Facebook, hoping to find their mystery man with little to go on: an African American travel agent in downtown D.C.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wrote a story about the search.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nTips came in and I made lots of calls, checking in with Ghannoum and striking out each time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I heard from Christine Lehnhoff.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMs Dvorak, I worked as a travel agent in D.C. during that time.

But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not so sure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I worried we would never know.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorsey died in February at 69, just seven months before Ghannoum, who is also 69, began his search.\\r\\n\\r\\nI left a message for his widow, Elaine. And so did Ghannoum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s son, Afif Ghannoum.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nShe remembered that night her husband came home short of cash with some crazy story about a guy who needed help.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t out of the norm for him to do something like this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she told me, after she connected all the dots, talked with Afif and was convinced her husband was Ghannoum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good Samaritan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was still the matter of the photos. Ghannoum didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recognize the salt-and-pepper-bearded Dorsey of 2019, the man who had been fighting liver and lung cancer for a decade. They were both 39 on that travel agency day.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Elaine sent the family older pictures of Dorsey, young and fit in Vietnam, with his postwar Afro and white suit in the 1970s, with his close-cropped hair and coach clothes in the 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh my God, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ghannoum said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s him, 100 percent.

Former senator and secretary of state William Cohen gave it to her sister, Robbie McCauley, after a shooting at the Holocaust Museum. (John Kelly/The Washington Post)\\r\\n\\r\\nColumnist\\r\\n\\r\\nThis summer, Anita Henderson, a retired District schoolteacher, was going through her Silver Spring basement with an eye toward downsizing.

In 2009, McCauley was in Washington to direct \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnne and Emmett,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a play written by Janet Langhart Cohen , who is married to William Cohen, the former U.S. senator and secretary of defense.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnne and Emmett\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is about an imagined meeting between Anne Frank and Emmett Till. It was to have its premiere at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum on June 10, 2009. That afternoon, as Langhart Cohen was being driven to the museum, a gunman burst in, killing security guard Stephen Tyrone Johns.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Cohen: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFive or six shots were fired right away. . . . [Afterward], everybody had been evacuated from the building except me and the actors and Robbie. None of us could leave.

He himself had been coming down the [entrance] steps while the shooting was happening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI remember being really panicked and breathing hard. . . . I remember Senator Cohen saying to me, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Just calm down.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I was shaking. I think it was air-conditioned, and I was shaking. And he gave me his jacket.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe black jacket was a men\\xe2\\x80\\x99s XL. Embroidered on the front were the words \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHead. Intelligence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCohen: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor a number of years I served on the board of Head Sports. One of their [tennis] rackets was called the Intelligence. . . . I had forgotten all about that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnita Henderson: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen she came home after the incident, apparently she just put the jacket down. Then it got in my basement closet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMcCauley: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find out until later who the guard who was shot was. And I remembered him, because he was such a nice man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJanet Langhart Cohen: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow ironic, how sad, that here we are in the 21st century, thinking that all of that hatred, racism and anti-Semitism are behind us, or at least underground, but here a neo-Nazi gets out of his car at a Jewish shrine, and he kills a black man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMcCauley: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRight now things are just shockingly surprising in terms of the public discourse and public events around these issues. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping that this is just revealing something that has always been there and that, now it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more public, we can begin to change for the better.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLanghart Cohen: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou think that these racist and anti-Semitic notions will die out. We look to the young and think, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, the old ones will die, and new ones will come.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Then you remember Dylann Roof and what happened at the border in El Paso recently. Young people have had this hate passed on to them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCohen: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust a few months ago, we were going to Baltimore to see a new production at Morgan State University and a pop-up came up on our phones saying there had been another [synagogue] shooting. It was actually six months to the day that a shooting had taken place [at a synagogue] in Pennsylvania. This one was out in California.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLanghart Cohen: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSadly, that day, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s timeless in a way. Racism and anti-Semitism are the gifts that keep on giving. You talk about that happening then, compared to where we are now, and it seems like the now and then have always been. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the reasons I wrote the play \\xe2\\x80\\x98Anne and Emmett.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHenderson: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was a lot of news around the [Holocaust Museum] incident. Some of it is beginning to fade with time. . . . I think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what made me think about how things have not really changed a lot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMcCauley: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[My sister] is one of those people who wants everything in its place. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a cleaner-upper in a way I wish I were. So she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been talking for years about: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, we have this jacket. Why don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we try to get it back to him?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 10 years, the jacket was hanging in Henderson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s basement, protected by a plastic bag. Clipped to it was an envelope with news clippings about the shooting. Together, they represented a reminder of that awful day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August, Henderson asked if I might help reunite the jacket with its owner. Last month, I picked it up at her home. This week, I dropped it off at Cohen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office.\\r\\n\\r\\nBye for now\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m taking a little break. I should be back in this space on Oct. 14.

      "b'The problem of sleeping in knows no cultural, geographic or demographic boundaries. This is a worldwide epidemic everyone knows about yet simply accepts (an understandable dilemma if resolving may require an earlier start to the day).\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the years, dozens of solutions have surfaced to get people out of bed in a timely fashion. (Not the least of which, of course, is to just go to sleep earlier to give your body the rest it needs \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but surely we can devise a solution more complicated than that!)\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is the old trick of putting your alarm clock on the other side of the room so you have to physically get out of bed to turn it off. Leveling up from that is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cClocky,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a clever little alarm clock that jumps off your nightstand and runs away and hides while its alarm rings. And, perhaps to take the cake, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHigh Voltage Ejector Bed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d literally catapults its sleeper out of bed in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo with all of these action-based product solutions, why does this issue still persist?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is because we are developing solutions that force ourselves up in the mornings rather than solutions that make us want to get up. We are willingly beginning our days with self-inflicted cruelty instead of trying to create an environment where it feels natural and comfortable to wake up early.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nProduct solutions punish our lack of self-discipline by harassing us into doing something we do not want to do. Many designs fall short of resolving the bigger picture problem and just act, instead, as negative additives to our daily routine. There are better solutions than this, though: Instead of looking at product design, we can turn to the design of our environment for solutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nSensory design is the strategy in architecture of designing spaces to appeal to multiple human senses (sight, sound, scent, taste, touch).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most successful, holistic designs are those that engage more than one sense: These spaces create the best experience and become the most memorable. Restaurants do this all the time: It is about more than just the food (and lack of cleanup); it is about the dining experience. Delicious aromas wafting by on trays, background music to set the mood, a velvety glass of red wine to start the meal \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 restaurants stimulate as many senses as they can to create a memorable experience. It is called creating \\xe2\\x80\\x9cambiance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (And the same can be applied to any dinner party you host \\xe2\\x80\\x94 ambiance through sensory design will surely make a more memorable experience than silence and a sandwich tray!)\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nRestaurants aside, most of our architecture \\xe2\\x80\\x94 homes, offices, retail, etc. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is designed primarily and almost exclusively for visual engagement, though. Those scents, tastes and sounds are all stripped down to leave us with a far less rich experience, even if the visuals are extremely interesting.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThink of closing your eyes in a large building. How would you navigate without sight? You would become reliant on your other senses: Maybe the texture of the flooring beneath your feet changes from one area to another area. Perhaps the bathrooms have lilies outside of them, giving off a light floral scent whenever you pass. What if you know you are passing a cafe by the music you hear playing?\\r\\n\\r\\nThese multisensory clues \\xe2\\x80\\x94 even if you are using all five senses \\xe2\\x80\\x94 create intuitive guidance, or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwayfinding,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which can influence behavior like how easily/successfully you navigate a space. That is the key: We are more inclined to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgo with the flow\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or do something if it is intuitive and feels natural, and sensory design is a great way to design for intuitive spaces.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a great strategy utilized by professional designers erecting new commercial buildings, but it is also a strategy that anyone outside of the industry can apply in the design of their own spaces in everyday life. Sensory design can be an excellent strategy for thinking of out-of-the-box solutions, especially where other solutions have failed to address environmental considerations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are a few ways to think about incorporating sensory design into your home:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xb7 Scent is an underrated sense: It often goes unnoticed until an odor comes along, then all we want is to cut off our sense of smell. Yet this is still a characteristic of any home, so think about design features that will define the scent of your home to your liking.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider what kind of ambiance you want in each room, then match a scent to it. Lavender might match a fresh and clean bathroom, vanilla may be cozy for the living room, sandalwood could be good for a relaxing bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese can be achieved by decor additives like live plants, reed diffusers, potpourri, candles (even unlit ones can be effective in smaller spaces) or even scented cleaning products (but all can be overcome if you do not have good ventilation in your kitchen and you frequently cook). Also remember that surfaces that trap dust, dirt and debris trap and harbor odors, too, so be selective on where you place those absorptive, harder-to-clean surfaces, like carpeting or even some decor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xb7 Flooring is an easy way to reevaluate your home environment using sensory design. For any given room, a flooring type is usually selected for its ease of cleaning and visual appeal, but different flooring materials have different acoustic properties, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nSound will bounce off hard flooring like wood, tile or concrete and \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in open floor plans \\xe2\\x80\\x94 can even echo. Carpet, on the other hand, absorbs sound (the kind of furniture you have in a room \\xe2\\x80\\x94 like all hard wood vs. all soft fabric \\xe2\\x80\\x94 can also affect how much or little sound bounces around a space).\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, consider how each flooring feels under your feet: Soft carpet is a different texture and communicates a different kind of space than cold tile. With a cohesive color palette, having a variety of flooring in your home can be a great way to denote the transition from one kind of space to another \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or even communicate the continuation of a space, rather than the separation. This is often why you see the flooring in kitchens continued underneath the breakfast nook or dining room. The continuous flooring indicates that, despite multiple elements in a space, everything is connected and considered in the same \\xe2\\x80\\x9czone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xb7 Doorbells are usually connected to a small speaker inside a house so you can hear when someone is ringing outside. However, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csmart\\xe2\\x80\\x9d doorbells that connect to your phone now buzz in your pocket or flash the screen at you to indicate someone is at the door. This is an excellent example of utilizing a multisensory home design element because if one of your senses is occupied \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for instance, if you have headphones on blasting music \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you will still get the alert and can greet your guests or retrieve your packages.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nSensory design can intuitively make a space more memorable and change how you interact with your environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, back to our problem: How can we use sensory design to make the environment work better for us and make getting out of bed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cintuitive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the morning?\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us assess. Alarm clocks are primarily auditory. How else can we break down this problem, and what other senses can we engage?\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider how the cooler the temperature is, and the more cocooned into snugly blankets we are, the less appealing the venture out into the rest of the room is.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat happens when the rest of the room is cozy and warm, too, though? What if it actually makes being under the blankets even slightly warmer than we prefer?\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nMost likely, your body will naturally decide it would rather change environments, or simply not require the cozy bed to be ideally comfortable anymore. Before you know it, using a sensory design approach, you could be up and out of bed without a single hit of the snooze button.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a quick reprogramming of the thermostat, or a space heater on a timer in the colder months, you can schedule the temperature to rise \\xe2\\x80\\x94 just a few degrees \\xe2\\x80\\x94 aligned with the timing of your alarm clock. Taking this multisensory approach by engaging auditory and thermal comfort (\\xe2\\x80\\x9ctouch\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) cues, instead of just the former, will design a more successful environment to motivate you to get out \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and stay out \\xe2\\x80\\x94 of bed. Then draw the blinds (daylighting/sight), turn on the coffee (olfactory, or scent) and eat breakfast (taste) to get you well on your way!\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are infinite tips, tricks and products to help people overcome problems and improve daily life. We are still challenged, though, because often people are the roots of their own problems \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and that can be hard to change. But, as they say, we are all products of our environment. So rather than consciously trying to force a habit that just will not stick \\xe2\\x80\\x94 like getting up on time in the morning \\xe2\\x80\\x94 consider focusing on changing the environment to influence behavior for the better.'\n",

      "b\"From one perspective, this rental property is owned by a company you own: a limited liability company (LLC). Over the years, this LLC received income from rent and paid your expenses on the property. At the end of each year, the LLC had a profit or loss, and the LLC's business is owning the rental property.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's generally hard for a homeowner to claim a property owned in an LLC as a primary residence for real estate tax purposes, if you live in a state where there are real estate taxes. With a few exceptions, it's also hard to claim the home is your primary residence on your federal income taxes while the property is owned in an LLC.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nTransferring the property out of the LLC could pose problems. From a local law perspective, that transfer in some states could trigger the payment of real estate transfer taxes and a reassessment or reevaluation of the property, causing the real estate taxes to go up substantially.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there are the federal income tax consequences. Many people who own property in an LLC report any gains or losses from the ownership of a rental property on their personal tax return. Professionals in the industry describe this as the LLC being a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdisregarded entity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If you file a separate tax return for your LLC and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a disregarded entity, the transfer of ownership from the LLC to you may be considered a sale of the LLC and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have capital gains and other taxes to pay from the transfer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best case scenario is that you own the property in the LLC, for federal income tax purposes, and the LLC is a disregarded entity; the transfer of the property from the LLC to your name would not trigger any real estate transfer taxes or cause the local taxing authorities to raise your taxes. If this is all true, then we get to the fun part. You now own the property in your own name. You would no longer be able to depreciate the property and you might be limited in the deductibility of real estate taxes, but you'd own it in your name.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nYou might not notice much difference owning it in your own name, but when it's time to sell the property, the differences will be huge. If this property had always been your primary residence or even a second residence but not a rental property, and you lived in it for two out of the last five years, you'd be entitled to keep your profits from the sale of the home without paying any federal income taxes on those profits. If you're single, you can exclude up to $250,000 of profits from federal income taxes, and if you are married, you and your spouse could exclude up to $500,000 from federal income taxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep in mind, there are other requirements. So, if you had a profit of $200,000 on the sale, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d get to keep the money and pay no federal income taxes on the sale.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut because you once owned the property in an LLC, as a rental property, you won't get the full benefit of the home sale exclusion. Uncle Sam will want you to pay taxes on the sale to recapture the depreciation you took when the property was a rental.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending on a variety of factors, the IRS could say that you owned the home for eight out of 10 years as a rental property, and the IRS may claim that you owe tax on 80 percent of the profits and could use the home sale exclusion for the other 20 percent. So, the longer you own the property as a primary residence, the more benefit you'd get from the home sale exclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo this leads us back to where we started. You need to talk to a good tax professional \\xe2\\x80\\x94 because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve really simplified our answer. There are other complications that relate to the amount of depreciation you took on the property over the years, among other issues. Discuss your intentions and the reasons you want to make the home your primary residence; those reasons could influence what you want to do with the home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you simply thought you could keep it for two years from the time you make the property your primary residence to get the full benefit \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and now you know that that won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you might decide to keep it as a rental. Or you could sell it and buy something else with the money using a 1031 tax deferred exchange.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\"\n",

      "b\"President Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order to withdraw essentially all U.S. forces from northern Syria came after the commander in chief privately agitated for days to bring troops home, according to administration officials \\xe2\\x80\\x94 even while the Pentagon was making public assurances that the United States was not abandoning its Kurdish allies in the region.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officials, granted anonymity to describe internal deliberations, described Trump as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoubling down\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cundeterred,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d despite vociferous pushback from congressional Republicans who have been loath to challenge the president apart from a few issues, such as national security.\\r\\n\\r\\nBehind the scenes, Trump has tried to convince advisers and lawmakers that the United States is not to blame for Turkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s military offensive, which has targeted Kurdish fighters who have aided the U.S. fight against the Islamic State.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut experts \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and many Republicans \\xe2\\x80\\x94 say otherwise. And even Trump allies say the president needs to do a better job of selling the troop withdrawal to the public, beyond tweets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe escalating crisis in northern Syria has prompted further criticism from foreign policy heavyweights in Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s party, who argue that the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strategies abroad send a concerning message to allies and endanger regional partners.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always looked at the approach the administration takes as very transactional and very short-term in nature,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d former senator Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a phone interview Sunday. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost seeking headlines for the very next day, but not really thinking through the longer-term impact on our \\xc2\\xadcountry.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a tweet and later in the interview, Corker warned against the decision to withdraw support for Kurdish forces, telling The Post that it was a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblight on our character.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He said, too, that it would only embolden Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has given no indication that he would halt the offensive that began Wednesday despite the threat of sanctions from the U.S. Congress and international condemnation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo pull the rug out and to do so in such a hasty manner, where there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been no preparation, nothing has been done to limit the damage to them, and as [former defense secretary Jim] Mattis and others have said, this is going to create additional activities, additional opportunities for ISIS . . . it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bad all the way around,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Corker, who has remained relatively quiet since he left office in January.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch criticisms have been echoed publicly and privately by current Republican elected officials who have been increasingly alarmed by the withdrawal, announced in a late-night White House statement on Oct. 6 and fully fleshed out by Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper on Sunday.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump has closely watched that kind of public criticism in recent days \\xe2\\x80\\x94 complaining frequently about comments from Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) in particular \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but has been encouraged to stay the course by other allies who support a withdrawal, such as Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson, according to administration officials.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe president, one senior administration official said, was particularly heartened by a segment from another Fox News host, Lou Dobbs, defending him last week.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA U.S. soldier sits atop an armored vehicle in Syria's Hasakeh province near the Turkish border on Oct. 6. (Delil Souleiman/Afp Via Getty Images)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor his part, Graham appeared to be more aligned with Trump on Sunday evening, saying that he planned to work with Democratic and Republican lawmakers on economic sanctions against Turkey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe outrage in Syria about Turkey continues. The ripple effect I was concerned about has happened at a faster pace than I believed. The administration needs to be far more aggressive,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Graham said in an interview.\\r\\n\\r\\nGraham and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) have drafted legislation that would place sanctions on the U.S. assets of people at the highest levels of the Turkish government, including Erdogan, as well as on any military transactions with Turkey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two are circulating their plan among Senate offices.\\r\\n\\r\\nGraham and Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) have also asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to arrange a briefing from the Pentagon and State Department, as well as intelligence officials, on the withdrawal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn aide to Schumer deferred to the majority leader\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office, although Schumer has said that he wants Esper; Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the head of U.S. Central Command, to appear publicly before senators. A spokesman for McConnell said Sunday that he had no announcements to make. A private briefing could help shape the congressional response, as could a closed-door Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Syria scheduled for Thursday morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Republican donors and officials worried that Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision would trap them in an untenable situation and have deleterious effects around the world. Furthermore, the significant intraparty rift is coming at a time when Trump particularly needs Republican support as he faces the threat of impeachment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRepublican senators are going to increasingly resemble a herd of ostriches with their heads in the sand,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Dan Eberhart, a prominent Republican donor. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to break with Trump while simultaneously wanting to disagree with his policy on allowing Turkey to get away with exterminating the Kurds inside Syria.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, Trump has resisted the repeated urging from some of his closest allies to intervene in the situation and has become more convinced that bringing troops home is both the right decision and a key political promise to fulfill ahead of the 2020 \\xc2\\xadelection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat view has been reinforced by the reaction from supporters. At a campaign rally in Minneapolis last week, the crowd chanted \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBring them home!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as Trump noted that U.S. troops had been in Afghanistan \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the longest war in American history \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for nearly two decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring deliberations in the past, Trump has repeatedly pushed to remove troops from Syria but has usually been dissuaded by top officials, such as John F. Kelly, his former chief of staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe usual argument against removing troops, according to former senior administration officials, would be that doing so would cause widespread deaths and chaos and Trump would be blamed for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNormally, convincing him he would be blamed for death and chaos could keep it from happening at least at that moment,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one former senior administration official said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut current administration officials say many moderating officials like Kelly are gone, and longtime friends say the move is consistent with Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worldview \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and that he has long wanted to do this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen he looks at a conflict, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say, do we have a national interest? What is our national interest?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Chris Ruddy, a Trump ally. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA secondary thing is the money issue. Why are we spending billions, if not trillions, in places like Afghanistan and the Middle East?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCorker also suggested that the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision was swayed by a circle of current advisers putting \\xe2\\x80\\x9cun-thought-out ideas in the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI just have known through my years there that so many people have access to the president,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Corker said, declining to name them. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTypically, you want the people who are giving input to have credentials and have knowledge of the area, but I know that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the case necessarily today.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Trump allies were urging him to do more. Retired Gen. Jack Keane, who regularly speaks with Trump and has been a candidate for positions in the past, said he should quickly enforce a no-fly zone and warn Turkish officials that there would be retaliation.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeane said international allies had flooded the State Department with concerns about trusting the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll is not lost,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. But not doing anything, he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csends a message about trust and reliability, something the United States has taken some pride in since World War II, that we can be counted on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\"\n",

According to the latest census data, Ward 1, which consists mostly of Columbia Heights, has the largest Latino population within the city. The Latino heritage is evident throughout the neighborhood. Various corners have boxes for the Spanish-language newspaper, the Washington Hispanic. The Latin American Youth Center on Columbia Road NW is an after-school community center for neighborhood kids. The GALA Hispanic Theatre on 14th Street promotes Hispanic heritage through theater productions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnthony Avery has lived in Columbia Heights for more than 14 years. For Avery, the neighborhood\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inclusive culture is what makes it home.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDifferent cultures are blending here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Avery said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a multicultural aspect as well as LGBTQ acceptance. Those things are important to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Avery loves the acceptance he has found in Columbia Heights, he has watched the neighborhood change immensely since he moved there. He points to the constant construction of condos, the new, expensive restaurants and the closing of mom-and-pop shops as examples of how gentrification has affected Columbia Heights. Avery offers advice for potential residents about being able to afford to live there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo look for a roommate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlotte Schwartz moved into the neighborhood two months ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gentrifying really fast, which sucks for the people who have lived here forever,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchwartz, who comes from a small town, enjoys the perks of living in a developing urban area.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a lot more going on here and a lot more people. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very diverse neighborhood, which is pretty cool,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Columbia Heights, along with the nearby Shaw and U Street neighborhoods, became home to many of the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s middle-class black residents. Nightclubs, bars and theaters thrived in this part of the city. Jazz giant Duke Ellington lived in Columbia Heights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, in 1968, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated and the riots that followed ravaged the city. Columbia Heights was one of the neighborhoods that bore some of the worst damage, as almost all of the businesses in the 14th Street corridor burned down. Residents fled into the suburbs and the neighborhood was left to rebuild.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nRebuilding was slow. It was not until the opening of the Columbia Heights Metro station in 1999 that the neighborhood started to recover in a substantial way. Since then, it has become a popular home for trendy restaurants such as Bad Saint on 11th Street. The tiny Filipino restaurant almost always has a line. Across the street from the Columbia Heights Metro station, retail developer DC USA opened a mall that includes a Target, Best Buy, and Bed Bath and Beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as the neighborhood has developed, crime has plagued its residents. One night last month, five people were shot, one fatally, on Columbia Road. A report by TV station WUSA9 found that violent crime was up nearly 60 percent year-to-date in the area surrounding the Columbia Road shooting and that nearly every month this year has been more violent than the three-year average for the neighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis has been a very tough year for our community, especially with gun violence,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Christine Miller, advisory neighborhood commissioner for ANC 1A05, wrote in an email. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy work before I became a commissioner and during has focused a lot on how we are lifting up and supporting our youth as the ultimate violence prevention. . . . We recognize that there is a role for the police and enforcement, but as community leaders, I have emphasized the proactive solutions we have available through schools, social service providers, and the many local organizations doing the hard work to ensure area youth are connected to the community in meaningful ways, have choices and opportunities.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nLiving there: Columbia Heights\\xe2\\x80\\x99 boundaries are 16th Street NW to the west, Sherman Avenue to the east, Spring Road to the north and Florida Avenue to the south.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 118 properties listed for sale in Columbia Heights. The most expensive is a three-bedroom, three-bathroom condo for $2.4 million. The least expensive is a rowhouse in need of substantial rehabilitation for $100,000. The average sales price of homes in Columbia Heights in 2018 was $617,441.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe bustling Columbia Heights neighborhood offers a wide variety of retail and dining options and a vibrant culture that together are otherwise difficult to find elsewhere in the city,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Homaira Karimi, an agent with TTR Sotheby\\xe2\\x80\\x99s International Realty, wrote in an email. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat along with its relatively affordable pricing and central location makes it an ideal neighborhood for both first-time and repeat home buyers. In taking a look at the numbers, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re seeing that Columbia Heights continues to remain more affordable than the rest of Northwest D.C., with the average sales price being 28 percent lower.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nKarimi said the median time of a Columbia Heights home on the market is 14 days, and properties are selling for 99 percent of their asking price.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Zillow.com, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $1,972. The neighborhood has six public housing projects.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchools: Tubman Elementary; Raymond Education Campus (kindergarten through eighth grade); Cardozo Education Campus (grades 6 through 12); and Columbia Heights Education Campus (grades 6 through 12)\\r\\n\\r\\nTransit: The Columbia Heights Metro station is at 14th and Irving streets NW. Several bus lines serve the neighborhood. Sherman and Florida avenues and 16th Street NW are major thoroughfares.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD'\n",

But there I was earlier this month, scarfing down diner-style Greek food in one of Washington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s four-star dining rooms.

The first marvel is a tiny taco whose dark filling, hidden beneath shredded lettuce, is a ringer for ground beef.

      "b'Overview\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo things stop me from making pot pies for other than special occasions: 1) The pastry, which takes time to make, roll, cut and shape. 2) The pastry, whose buttery goodness can make it seem a little too indulgent for any old weeknight.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Scale and get a printer-friendly version of the recipe here.]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a shame, because the nostalgic pull of a pot pie is so strong. My favorite way around the obstacles is to use something else entirely for the top, the way author Laura Wright does in this recipe from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe First Mess Cookbook.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Her \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccrust\\xe2\\x80\\x9d consists of thinly sliced sweet potatoes whose edges crisp up during baking. You make them in ramekins, gratin dishes or other small ovenproof dishes, giving them that one-portion-just-for-you appeal of the frozen ones from my childhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe traditional filling, of course, is chunks of chicken, coins of carrots and peas in a white gravy. Wright takes the same down-home approach but makes the dish a little more interesting \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and appealing to fans of plant-based recipes. Her filling is a hearty stew of white beans, zucchini and aromatic vegetables, bound by a sauce based on vegetable broth but enlivened by a little tomato paste, a small splash of white wine and chopped rosemary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the only way I want to eat a pot pie, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I want tonight. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll save the pastry for another day.\\r\\n\\r\\nVegetable and Bean Pot Pies With Sweet Potato Crusts Serve these with a salad and a piece of good bread for a simple and nourishing meal. You can slice the sweet potato by hand or use a mandoline, if you have one, for easier, more consistently thin slices. Make Ahead: The filling can be prepared, and the pot pies assembled and refrigerated, covered, for up to 3 days. Bring to room temperature before baking.\\r\\n\\r\\nIngredients\\r\\n\\r\\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\\r\\n\\r\\n1 medium yellow onion, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (1 1/2 cups)\\r\\n\\r\\n1 medium carrot, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (3/4 cup)\\r\\n\\r\\n1 rib celery, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (3/4 cup)\\r\\n\\r\\n4 cloves garlic, finely chopped\\r\\n\\r\\n1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary, plus sprigs for optional garnish\\r\\n\\r\\n1 teaspoon tomato paste\\r\\n\\r\\n1 medium zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (2 cups)\\r\\n\\r\\nOne (14-ounce) can no-salt-added white beans, such as navy, cannellini or great northern (1 1/2 cups), rinsed and drained\\r\\n\\r\\n2 tablespoons dry white wine (may substitute 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar plus 1 tablespoon water)\\r\\n\\r\\n3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, or more as needed\\r\\n\\r\\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more as needed\\r\\n\\r\\n2 tablespoons flour\\r\\n\\r\\n1 1/2 cups vegetable broth\\r\\n\\r\\n1 medium (9-ounce) sweet potato, peeled and sliced as thinly as possible (see overview)\\r\\n\\r\\nSteps\\r\\n\\r\\nStep 1\\r\\n\\r\\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees with the rack in the middle. Place five ramekins or other 1-cup-capacity ovenproof dishes on a large rimmed baking sheet.\\r\\n\\r\\nStep 2\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a large saucepan over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Add the onion, carrot and celery, and cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in the garlic, rosemary and tomato paste, then gently stir in the zucchini and beans. Pour in the wine and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, taste, and add more of each, if needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nStep 3\\r\\n\\r\\nSprinkle the \\xef\\xac\\x82our over the vegetable mixture. Stir until the flour is moistened and starting to get pasty, about 1 minute. Stir in the vegetable broth. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat to medium-low so the mixture is at a simmer and cook until lightly thickened, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nStep 4\\r\\n\\r\\nDivide the stew among the ramekins. Arrange the sweet potato slices on top of the ramekins in a fan or layered pattern. Gently brush them with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.\\r\\n\\r\\nStep 5\\r\\n\\r\\nBake 30 to 35 minutes, until the filling is bubbling and the sweet potato slices are tender and lightly browned on the edges.

      "b'Chronic pain is a widespread problem in the United States. According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 50 million Americans suffer from some form of chronic pain; nearly 20 million of those people have high-impact chronic pain , which is persistent and affects a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to carry out day-to-day activities, resulting in a lower quality of life. Chronic pain is also frequently associated with a higher prevalence of mood disorders such as depression and anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough pain is nearly universal \\xe2\\x80\\x94 almost everyone will deal with a bout of serious pain in a lifetime \\xe2\\x80\\x94 chronic pain can be challenging to treat. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen you look at the landscape of society, the number-one reason people go to the doctor is because something hurts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Yury Khelemsky, an anesthesiologist and associate professor at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Many of these patients have \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunderlying issues that can be corrected,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Khelemsky says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor instance, if you have abdominal pain and gallstones, you can take the gallbladder out, and it gets better.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That is called acute pain, and it usually resolves within six months.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Why icing a sprain doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help, and could slow recovery]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother group of people have what Khelemsky calls \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvague\\xe2\\x80\\x9d pain \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when the source is unclear \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that lasts more than six months. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps chronic muscle, joint, back or knee pain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he says. It could be pain that continues after an illness has ended or an injury has healed, or it could involve conditions such as fibromyalgia, arthritis, neuropathy, back problems or irritable bowel syndrome. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmong this group, with some, we know what it is, and we can kind of fix it; some, we really can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fix it, or the treatments don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fix it a good proportion of the time. We see that much more often in our profession,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Khelemsky says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere just isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a good permanent solution.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is chronic pain, and treating it requires more than the occasional appointment and prescription for medication or therapy. In recognition of that fact, the medical community is turning to other approaches, including increasing patient support and education and improving overall wellness, perhaps with alternative treatments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncreased support\\r\\n\\r\\nOne factor researchers are looking at is continued care outside of office visits. A pilot study published in the Clinical Journal of Pain examined the impact of supportive text messages with guidance and encouragement, such as, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMake plans to spend time with a friend or family member today by phone or video chat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are in control of your health and happiness. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let the small setbacks you experience discourage you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The researchers found these texts reduced patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 perception of their pain and decreased the extent to which it hindered their day-to-day life.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2019 study of 294 chronic pain patients examined how other out-of-office treatments might improve pain symptoms, as well as mood-related conditions such as depression and anxiety. In the research, the first group of patients were put on a Web-based self-management program with modules about coping with pain, pain medications, communicating with providers, cognitive strategies and more; the patients did regular self-reporting of symptoms and got reminders to complete their modules.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second group was treated with the Web-based self-management program, but the patients were also monitored by a nurse who would contact them to add and adjust medications for pain and facilitate mental health referrals for depression and anxiety,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to study lead researcher Kurt Kroenke, professor of medicine at Indiana University and a research scientist at Regenstrief Institute. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe nurse had weekly care management meetings with the supervising physician to develop treatment plans for new patients as well as those who were not responding adequately to their current treatment regimens,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he says.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe results of continued care were promising. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoth groups had moderate improvement in their pain and mood symptoms, and the improvement was superior what has historically been seen in primary care studies where the control arm simply received \\xe2\\x80\\x98usual primary care,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Kroenke says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe patient group that additionally received telecare from the nurse-physician team had further improvement beyond that experienced by the group that only received online self-management.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMore providers and health systems are implementing digital methods of care, such as patient portals, so patients can reach their physicians to communicate progress. Using technology to bolster treatment and educate patients could prove especially helpful for those who have chronic conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nKroenke says it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s critical that patients with pain receive more than a single appointment with a doctor during a busy day. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll single treatments have, on average, modest effects in reducing pain, which means that changing, adjusting or combining treatments is often necessary to optimize outcomes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he says. That means \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfollowing up at regular intervals to monitor and adjust treatment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard W. Rosenquist, chairman of the department of pain management at the Cleveland Clinic, believes patients with chronic pain benefit from attending organized programs run by a variety of medical specialists to keep up with treatment and self-care options. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have a program at Cleveland Clinic called Back on TREK ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a chronic back pain program with psychologists, physical therapists, spine specialists and other physicians involved. Part of chronic-pain healing is the shared experience; people with back pain find out they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not alone in the world \\xe2\\x80\\x94 there are other people with the same problem.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of these programs exist across the country for other conditions. For instance, Dan Clauw, director of the Chronic Pain & Fatigue Research Clinic at the University of Michigan, holds regular seminars about living with and managing fibromyalgia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s promising research that patient education may relieve pain symptoms or improve physical functioning. In a study of people with low-back pain, receiving one-on-one counseling with a physiotherapist increased their ability to do a forward bend and straight leg raise. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also evidence that public education on chronic pain, through means such as social media and education classes, can help people avoid risk factors and advocate for family members who are experiencing pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoosting overall wellness\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother factor in managing and preventing chronic pain is overall wellness. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe first thing is to stay physically fit and physically active,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Khelemsky says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I could change one thing [it would be that] everyone would eat a proper diet and do some type of physical activity where you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re using your muscles. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just good for the physical body, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good for the emotional state, as well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMaintaining a healthy weight can also help long-term, so you are not stressing your joints. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have to think of the downstream effect of the pain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Khelemsky says, noting that people tend to experience more of it as they get older. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf people set themselves up to deal with pain better, disability and suffering decreases.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also more doctors and hospitals with integrative programs, such as the Duke University Medical Center, the University of California at San Francisco and Mayo Clinic. This approach considers non-traditional therapies such as yoga, acupuncture, meditation and more as part of a holistic approach to treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn our wellness institute, we have an integrative pain program that involves using tai chi, diet changes, therapy and other lifestyle changes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rosenquist says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have a Functional Medicine Center led by Dr. Mark Hyman, which focuses on improving access to care, looking at the role of psychology, the diet and exercise in treating chronic pain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll of these contribute to reducing overall levels of pain and are things that are actually important when looking at a long-term view,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rosenquist says.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re smoking, overweight or sedentary, the likelihood of good long-term outlook goes down. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to talk about the lifestyle change.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFunctional medicine physicians may look through a different lens than your primary care physician. Yeral Patel, a family medicine physician and integrative specialist in Newport Beach, Calif., says she sees lots of patients for chronic pain syndromes, injury recovery, back and neck pain, and carpal tunnel. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFunctional medicine doctors try to dig deeper and look at the root causes of the pain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Patel says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe try to identify the possible causes of inflammation, such as gut dysfunction, micronutrient deficiency, insulin resistance and inflammatory markers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter taking an extensive history and doing a battery of tests to look at smaller contributing factors that might be preventing recovery, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get an integrative plan \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat utilizes nutrition, exercise and diet, supplements, and mediation for stress management,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Patel says.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe has also found alternative therapies helpful. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAcupuncture is great to add as an adjunctive therapy and helps release endorphins, the \\xe2\\x80\\x98feel good\\xe2\\x80\\x99 hormones that can help relieve pain and improve a patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sense of well-being,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Patel says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSupplements taken with a physician\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guidance such as turmeric, omega-3, B vitamins, Quercetin and Boswellia are great for decreasing inflammation and alleviating pain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Always let your doctor know of current regular and pain medications you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re taking before starting supplements, so they can check interactions.\\r\\n\\r\\nJenna Birch is a journalist, dating coach and author of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Love Gap: A Radical Plan to Win in Life and Love.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d'\n",

Sign up for the Today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s WorldView newsletter.\\r\\n\\r\\nA week ago, President Trump shocked Washington and announced he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t impede an imminent Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria. Now, in the space of just a few days, his administration is already reaping what it sowed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incursions at various points along its border with Syria began on Wednesday and, by the weekend, had already plunged the region into chaos. Turkish artillery pounded Syrian Kurdish positions, while footage emerged appearing to show Turkish-affiliated militiamen carrying out grisly roadside executions of Kurdish fighters allied to the United States. Tens of thousands of panicked civilians attempted to flee the Turkish-led advance, raising fears of an eventual exodus into Iraqi Kurdistan, where more than a million people displaced by conflict still live in camps.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump, who spent part of the weekend at one of his golf courses, insisted on Twitter that his country ought to be rid of its commitments in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cquicksand\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the Middle East. Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper told CBS\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFace the Nation\" on Sunday that the United States was now in \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca very untenable situation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and would evacuate its roughly 1,000 troops in northeastern Syria entirely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe order to remove troops came Saturday, toward the end of a chaotic day in which the viability of the U.S. mission in Syria rapidly unraveled after Turkish troops and their Syrian rebel proxies advanced deep into Syrian territory and cut U.S. supply lines,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d my colleagues reported. It flew in the face of the Pentagon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assurances last week that the United States would not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabandon\\xe2\\x80\\x9d its Syrian Kurdish partners, who have been on the front lines in the war against the Islamic State and borne the brunt of the casualties in a U.S.-led campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut security headaches have only mushroomed amid American maneuvers to withdraw. Hundreds of Islamic State detainees may have escaped a prison camp run by beleaguered Syrian Kurdish fighters. Separately, in the late hours of Sunday, reports indicated that Syrian regime forces were also converging on areas once guarded by the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurdish-led alliance now in Turkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crosshairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHung out to dry by the United States, the SDF turned to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for protection. A senior Syrian Kurdish politician told Reuters that SDF officials met counterparts in the Assad regime at a Russian air base in Syria to hash out a deal. By Sunday evening, the SDF confirmed that, to repel or stall the Turkish invasion, it had invited the regime into areas it had formerly controlled with U.S. protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many on the ground, this seemed an inevitable and relatively welcome outcome. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor the regime to intervene and deploy its forces on the Turkish border is a comforting thought,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a Syrian Kurdish woman, who gave her name as Nowruz, told my colleagues. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf a deal with the regime is what it takes to stop these massacres, then so be it. At the end of the day, we are all Syrians, and the regime is Syrian, too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTurkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thinly veiled goal in launching the invasion was to smash Rojava, the name for the autonomous enclave in northeastern Syria carved out by the SDF over the past few years. Ankara views the main Syrian Kurdish faction as a direct outgrowth of the PKK, an outlawed Kurdish separatist group that has fought a bloody decades-long insurgency in Turkey. If northeastern Syria falls back under the security umbrella of Damascus, that may in and of itself be a satisfying outcome for the Turks. Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role in brokering the rapprochement between Assad and the Syrian Kurds after the Turkish invasion may be a sign, analysts suggested, of a tacit Syrian endgame being thrashed out by the Turks and the Russians.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration painted itself as a somewhat helpless bystander. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have American forces likely caught between two opposing advancing armies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Esper told CBS. In his Sunday tweets, Trump seemed to wave away any interest in the battle and reiterated his position that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery smart not to be involved in the intense fighting\" along the Syrian-Turkish border. This followed reports Friday that Turkish artillery appeared to be firing multiple \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbracketing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rounds near positions manned by U.S. Special Forces, an astonishing act by a NATO ally that U.S. officials thought was deliberate.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you remember two years ago when Iraq was going to fight the Kurds in a different part of Syria. Many people wanted us to fight with the Kurds against Iraq, who we just fought for. I said no, and the Kurds left the fight, twice. Now the same thing is happening with Turkey...... \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2019\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump attempted to underscore his point of view with a garbled history lesson, but it only emphasized his lack of genuine engagement with the intricacies of Middle East policy. He brought up a supposed incident in 2017 when \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIraq was going to fight the Kurds in a different part of Syria\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and his critics then also urged the United States to stand by their Kurdish allies. But no such event took place. Trump was possibly thinking of the Iraqi government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seizure of the city of Kirkuk \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in Iraq \\xe2\\x80\\x94 from the control of fighters affiliated with factions based in the semiautonomous Iraqi region of Kurdistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever the case, some experts argued that the sudden American departure from northeastern Syria was inevitable \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if not the chaotic manner in which it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being carried out. Trump has been determined for months to pull out U.S. forces. The American support of the SDF \\xe2\\x80\\x94 no matter the great affection for the Syrian Kurdish fighters among U.S. politicians and military officials \\xe2\\x80\\x94 was always in conflict with Washington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s need to keep Turkey on its side.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, somewhat in opposition to the president, senior Trump officials steered a policy that let the SDF think it had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindefinite\\xe2\\x80\\x9d backing from the United States. They also pursued an ambitious agenda of ending Iranian influence in Syria, a goal that is deeply at odds with Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire for an exit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor three years we have kidded ourselves about this, and those that pushed policies at odds with Trump, working to sketch out a maximalist policy that ignored Ankara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s obvious intent, and the wishes of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most powerful man, should be ashamed,\" said Aaron Stein, director of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, to Al-Monitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?

      "b'When President Trump announced his decision to pull troops from northern Syria, his critics immediately warned that the move would pave the way for a Turkish offensive with potentially catastrophic repercussions.\\r\\n\\r\\nState Department officials swiftly denied that Trump supported the Turkish incursion. Meanwhile, Trump appeared convinced that he had made the right choice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTurkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey now indeed are, but not to the advantage of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clear is that the U.S. has shot itself into the foot,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ali Fathollah-Nejad, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho are likely winners?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. pullout has enabled Turkey to pursue its military incursion without having to fear U.S. interference, but it has also created opportunities for four of the United States\\xe2\\x80\\x99 key foes: Iran, the Assad regime, Russia and \\xe2\\x80\\x94 potentially \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the Islamic State group.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho is set to lose most?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest losers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it appears at this stage \\xe2\\x80\\x94 are the allies who fought alongside U.S. soldiers in Syria: Europe and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former are afraid that the move will free Islamic State prisoners held in Kurdish prisons and camps and expose Europe to new militant attacks after a period of relative calm. The latter had established a de facto state in the north of Syria over the last years \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in large parts in places previously ruled by the Islamic State. The Kurds hoped that their territory was somewhat protected by a U.S. military presence that acted as a deterrent.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow did we get to this point?\\r\\n\\r\\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long viewed the Kurdish-held territory in Syria as a safe haven for the Kurdistan Workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Party, or PKK \\xe2\\x80\\x94 whom Erdogan considers to be a terrorist group.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, to the south of the Kurdish-held territories, Russia and Iran-backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has been waiting for an opportunity to seize back the cities and swaths of land he lost during the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s announcement of a pullout one week ago offered an opening for both Erdogan and Assad. On Wednesday, Turkish troops began their offensive at multiple points along the Turkish-Syrian border. Turkish artillery fire on the Kurds, a mass exodus of civilians and apparent footage of roadside executions of Kurdish fighters soon followed. Hundreds of Islamic State family members escaped detention, according to Kurdish officials.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout U.S. backing and amid mounting chaos, the Kurds appeared to face the choice between a deadly confrontation with the militarily superior Turkish forces \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or a deal with the Assad regime.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy Sunday, the SDF had opted for the second option: They announced a deal with the Syrian government to allow forces loyal to the regime to enter its territory. By Monday, Syrian government troops were raising flags in the towns close to the Turkish-Syrian border in a move that could make the presence of the remaining U.S. troops in the region unsustainable.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow do the Assad regime, Russia and Iran benefit?\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the United States voluntarily giving up much of its leverage in Syria, Russia has likely the most to gain. Throughout the Syrian civil war, Russia has staunchly supported the Assad regime. Over the weekend, the New York Times revealed that the Russian Air Force deliberately and repeatedly bombed Syrian hospitals in rebel-held areas, indicating how far Russia is willing to go to support Assad.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut apart from military force, Russian President Vladimir Putin has also pushed ahead with diplomatic initiatives, positioning him at the center of the Syrian morass. The U.S. pullout expands the Russian leverage in at least two ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirstly, the strengthening of the Assad regime would inevitably also bolster Russia, a key backer.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut ironically, it could also help to deepen Moscow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ties to the country Assad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forces may now face off in northern Syria: Turkey. With the United States potentially poised to impose sanctions on Turkey, as Trump indicated Monday, Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rapprochement with Turkey could speed up \\xe2\\x80\\x94 despite the countries\\xe2\\x80\\x99 differing interests in Syria.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perspective, this apparent contradiction may not seem so contradictory at all. In the past, Moscow has argued that SDF fighters should yield control to the Assad regime. The Turkish incursion and U.S. pullout may lead to exactly such a scenario, as Sunday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deal between the SDF and the Assad regime appeared to suggest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe developments of the last week may also be an opportunity for Iran, another backer of the Assad regime. The U.S. pullout, said Brookings researcher Fathollah-Nejad, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill expand Iran\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opportunities to engage with Kurds and portray itself as the only reliable partner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This could help Tehran restrict the Kurds\\xe2\\x80\\x99 drive for empowerment, which Iran opposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Fathollah-Nejad cautioned that Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Iran\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interests in Syria were not necessarily aligned and that the Turkish incursion may still end up becoming a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdouble-edged sword\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for Iran, which explains why Iranian officials have officially condemned the Turkish offensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nIranian officials may fear a radicalization of Kurdish separatism, said Fathollah-Nejad, and a full-blown resurgence of the Islamic State.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow does Islamic State gain?\\r\\n\\r\\nAmid the backlash against his decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria, Trump went on the offensive last week and blamed European countries for what he suggested was a lack of willingness to take back Islamic State fighters born in Europe and held by the Syrian Kurds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEurope had a chance to get their ISIS prisoners, but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want the cost,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump reiterated on Monday.\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropean officials have rejected Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s criticism, arguing that Islamic State returnees would in many cases walk free in Europe, as authorities often lack evidence for crimes committed in Syria or Iraq. Despite fierce criticism from human rights advocates, major European governments have opted to leave Islamic State fighters in Kurdish detention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. pullout has now resulted in an outcome detrimental both to U.S. counterterrorism officials and their European counterparts. Some 785 people affiliated with the Islamic State escaped from a camp on Sunday, according to Kurdish officials.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from the escape of former Islamic State fighters or supporters, European officials worry that the chaos of renewed widespread military conflict in that part of Syria could provide the Islamic State group with an opening to conduct new attacks and rebuild its organization.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more:\\r\\n\\r\\nSyrian troops enter towns in northeast as Erdogan warns of wider offensive\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Trump withdraws U.S. forces from northern Syria, his administration scrambles to respond\\r\\n\\r\\nUnswayed by top advisers, Trump doubles down on decision to withdraw troops'\n",

      "b'Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks at a summit in Turkmenistan on Friday. (Alexei Druzhinin/Sputnik/Kremlin Pool/AP)\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Mariana Alfaro\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BIG IDEA: Vladimir Putin has won so much these past three years that he may get tired of winning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. intelligence community\\xe2\\x80\\x99s January 2017 report on Russian interference in the previous year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidential campaign sought to explain why Donald Trump was so attractive to Moscow. This sentence has fresh salience: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPro-Kremlin proxy Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, proclaimed just before the election that if [Trump] won, Russia would \\xe2\\x80\\x98drink champagne\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in anticipation of being able to advance its positions on Syria and Ukraine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nComing on the heels of Trump holding up assistance for Ukraine as his administration urged its new president to investigate a Democratic challenger, Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order on Saturday to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria has given the Russians a new reason to reach for the bubbly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American retreat forced our Kurdish allies, outmanned and outgunned by the invading Turks, to turn toward the Kremlin and seek help from Bashar al-Assad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regime in Damascus that they had spent years fighting to break away from. Syrian government forces, propped up by the Russian military, have long been held in abeyance by the U.S. presence. Now they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re filling the vacuum. Kurdish leaders announced late Sunday that they have invited these troops into towns that have been under their control for years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe announcement by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that they had reached an agreement with the Iranian- and Russian-backed government of [Assad] further undermined the prospect of any continued U.S. presence in the country,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Liz Sly, Louisa Loveluck, Asser Khattab and Sarah Dadouch report. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe deal followed three days of negotiations brokered by Russia between the Syrian government and the SDF, which had reached the conclusion that it could no longer count on the United States, its chief ally for the past five years in the fight against the Islamic State \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 It represents a gamble for the Kurds, who appeared to have secured no guarantees for the survival of the autonomy they have secured over the area over the past seven years. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBadran Jia Kurd, a senior Kurdish official, said the Kurds felt they had no choice but to turn to Damascus in light of what he called the \\xe2\\x80\\x98betrayal\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of the United States. \\xe2\\x80\\x98This has obliged us to look for alternative options,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he said. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Residents of northeast Syria said they were stunned by the speed with which SDF defenses appeared to be collapsing \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Hundreds of Islamic State family members escaped a detention camp after Turkish shellfire hit the area, U.S. troops pulled out from another base and Turkish-backed forces consolidated their hold over a vital highway, cutting the main U.S. supply route into Syria.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want the Russians and Syrians in there, but obviously we understand why they reached out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a senior Trump administration official told one of my colleagues. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is total chaos,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the official added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca total s---storm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA Turkish-backed fighter fires Sunday during clashes in the border town of Ras al-Ayn as Turkey and its allies continue their assault on Kurdish-held border towns in northeastern Syria. (Nazeer Al-Khatib/AFP/Getty Images)\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Mazloum Abdi, the commander in chief of the SDF, said the Kurds didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want it to turn out this way: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe believe in democracy as a core concept, but in light of the invasion by Turkey and the existential threat its attack poses for our people, we may have to reconsider our alliances,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Abdi writes in a new Foreign Policy op-ed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe know that we would have to make painful compromises with Moscow and Bashar al-Assad if we go down the road of working with them. But if we have to choose between compromises and the genocide of our people, we will surely choose life for our people. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt Washington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request, we agreed to withdraw our heavy weapons from the border area with Turkey, destroy our defensive fortifications, and pull back our most seasoned fighters. Turkey would never attack us so long as the U.S. government was true to its word with us. We are now standing with our chests bare to face the Turkish knives,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he adds. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe know that the United States is not the world police. But we do want the United States to acknowledge its important role in achieving a political solution for Syria. We are sure that Washington has sufficient leverage to mediate a sustainable peace between us and Turkey.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPutin likely can\\'t believe his luck,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a Western military official from a NATO member country, who recently served in Syria as part of the anti-ISIS coalition, told Business Insider. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA third of Syria was more or less free of ISIS and its security was good without any involvement of the regime or Russia, and now because of the Turkish invasion and American pullout, this area is wide open to return to government control. What was supposed to be a diplomatically complex issue that would have involved U.S. and European military power suddenly got as simple as sending in tanks and units unopposed throughout the eastern third of Syria.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPutin continues to get whatever he wants and generally doesn\\'t even have to do much,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d an unnamed NATO official also told Insider. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe got to sit back and watch the Turks and the Americans unravel five years of success and not only did it not cost him anything, he didn\\'t even have to try to make it happen. Small wonder he\\'d interfere on Trump\\'s side in an election.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- The Russian Air Force has repeatedly bombed hospitals in Syria to crush the last pockets of resistance to Assad, according to a damning New York Times investigation published on Sunday: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn analysis of previously unpublished Russian Air Force radio recordings, plane spotter logs and witness accounts allowed The Times to trace bombings of four hospitals in just 12 hours in May and tie Russian pilots to each one. The 12-hour period beginning on May 5 represents a small slice of the air war in Syria, but it is a microcosm of Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s four-year military intervention in Syria\\xe2\\x80\\x99s civil war. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Physicians for Human Rights, an advocacy group that tracks attacks on medical workers in Syria, has documented at least 583 such attacks since 2011, 266 of them since Russia intervened in September 2015. At least 916 medical workers have been killed since 2011. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRussia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council has shielded it from scrutiny and made United Nations agencies reluctant to accuse the Russian Air Force of responsibility. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 The United Nations secretary general, Ant\\xc3\\xb3nio Guterres, opened an investigation into the hospital bombings in August. The investigation, still going on, is meant in part to determine why hospitals that voluntarily added their locations to a United Nations-sponsored deconfliction list, which was provided to Russia and other combatants to prevent them from being attacked, nevertheless came under attack. Syrian health care workers said they believed that the United Nations list actually became a target menu for the Russian and Syrian air forces.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrump tried to keep his talks with Putin at Helsinki last year secret from his staff and the world, but Russia\\'s president held up the checklist for the cameras. Syria was on it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Julia Davis recalls in the Daily Beast: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrump is moving down Putin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wish list, fulfilling the Kremlin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aims at a rapid pace. He is chipping away at U.S. sanctions against Russia, deepening America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s internal divisions on the basis of race, faith, sexual orientation and political affiliation, vocally undermining confidence in our elections, intelligence agencies and institutions, all the while empowering our foreign adversaries and undermining NATO alliances. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claims that Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x94not Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x94is somehow responsible for the 2016 election interference fall right in line with conspiracy theories the Kremlin has been propagating for years. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe ousting of Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, was also in line with the Kremlin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wishes. Ukrainian politician Viktor Medvedchuk [Putin is the godfather of his daughter] has a longstanding grudge against Ambassador Yovanovitch. Medvedchuk cheered for the U.S. ambassador to be recalled and the Russian state media predicted that Ambassador Yovanovitch would be Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x98first victim in Ukraine.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWashington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s abrupt decision to ditch the Kurds contrasted sharply with Moscow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unwavering support for its ally Assad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the AP\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Vladimir Isachenkov reports from Moscow. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn another power game, Russia hopes to see major gains in its long-running effort to retain leverage over its neighbor Ukraine \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who was elected by a landslide in April, has vowed to end the fighting [in eastern Ukraine], which has killed more than 13,000. Early this month, Ukraine, Russia and the rebels signed a tentative agreement to hold local elections in the east, a deal Zelenskiy insists conforms to a 2015 peace accord that was brokered by France and Germany. The agreement, however, has been criticized by some in Ukraine as \\xe2\\x80\\x98capitulation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to Moscow. On Monday, far-right and nationalist groups are staging a major rally in Kyiv to protest Zelenskiy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s peace plan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe White House\\xe2\\x80\\x99s publication of a rough transcript of the call was embarrassing for the 41-year-old Ukrainian president because it showed him eager to please Trump and dismissive of European partners whose support he needs to end the conflict in the east. While Zelenskiy sought to play it down, it could help Russia by eroding support for Ukraine in Germany and France. \\xe2\\x80\\x98France and Germany have grown tired of Ukraine and are too busy with their own problems, and their only goal is to close the issue of the war in the east by any means,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Vadim Karasev, head of the Institute of Global Strategies, an independent Kyiv-based think tank. \\xe2\\x80\\x98If Russia offers a compromise, Berlin and Paris will heave a sigh of relief. By publicly kicking (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel and (French President Emmanuel) Macron, Zelenskiy untied their hands and there is no more talk about their \\xe2\\x80\\x98friendly support.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Syria and Ukraine fit with a broader pattern. Trump has pushed to bring Russia back into the Group of Seven, which it was expelled from after invading Ukraine. To fund construction of his border wall, he diverted $770 million from projects that have been approved to help American allies deter Russian attacks. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cast doubt on whether the U.S. would live up to its mutual defense obligations under the NATO charter. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supported Brexit and antagonized the European Union by picking fights over trade. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impossible to calculate the Kremlin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s return on investment for its 2016 interference in the U.S. election. Trump told two senior Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting in 2017 that he was unconcerned about their interference in our presidential election because the United States does the same in other countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n-- As 2020 approaches, there is no doubt that Russian interests continue to favor Trump. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the Soviet-born associates of Rudy Giuliani who were arrested last Wednesday night at Dulles as they prepared to leave the U.S. with one-way plane tickets to Europe, have made $630,000 in contributions to Republican candidates and political action committees since the fall of 2016, including $325,000 to a pro-Trump PAC. The men have been charged with campaign finance violations, including routing illegal contributions to federal candidates from an unidentified Russian source.\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Before leaving the White House to hit the links at his golf course on Sunday, Trump defended his decision as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery smart\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and accused \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthose that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of pushing the United States to stay in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cendless wars.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump tweeted that it was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For the past week, White House officials have been adamant that Trump did not greenlight Turkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s invasion. But Trump undercut those denials somewhat with his tweets. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOthers may want to come in and fight for one side or the other,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he wrote. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet them!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order to withdraw came after he privately agitated for days to bring troops home, according to administration officials, even while the Pentagon was making public assurances that the United States was not abandoning its Kurdish allies in the region. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe officials, granted anonymity to describe internal deliberations, described Trump as \\xe2\\x80\\x98doubling down\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98undeterred,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 despite vociferous pushback from congressional Republicans who have been loath to challenge the president,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Seung Min Kim and Josh Dawsey report.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDuring deliberations in the past, Trump has repeatedly pushed to remove troops from Syria but has usually been dissuaded by top officials, such as John F. Kelly, his former chief of staff. The usual argument against removing troops, according to former senior administration officials, would be that doing so would cause widespread deaths and chaos and Trump would be blamed for it. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Normally, convincing him he would be blamed for death and chaos could keep it from happening at least at that moment,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 one former senior administration official said. But current administration officials say many moderating officials like Kelly are gone, and longtime friends say the move is consistent with Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worldview \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and that he has long wanted to do this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump has closely watched conservative criticism in recent days: He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s complained frequently about comments from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) but has been encouraged by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Fox News host Tucker Carlson, according to administration officials. One senior administration official told Josh that the president was particularly heartened by a segment from another Fox host, Lou Dobbs, defending him last week.\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Graham, who previously called Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision on Syria \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe biggest blunder of his presidency,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d praised the president on Sunday for saying he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll support imposing some sanctions on Turkey. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTurkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions will only benefit ISIS, Iran, and Russia, and creates a nightmare for Israel,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Graham tweeted.\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Turkey was fully committed to its operation regardless of what the United States did, and that the administration did not want to go to war with a member of NATO. Esper added that Turkey is not acting like much of an ally. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think Turkey, the arc of their behavior over the past several years, has been terrible,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFox News Sunday.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI mean, they are spinning out of the Western orbit, if you will.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) said NATO should consider expelling Turkey as a member, citing Ankara\\xe2\\x80\\x99s partnership with Moscow: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow do you have a NATO ally who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in cahoots with the Russians when the Russians are the adversaries of NATO? ... [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bad guy, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m disgusted that the American president would feel comfortable with someone like Erdogan,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Engel said on NBC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMeet the Press,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d promising that the House will take up sanctions against Turkey this week and on a resolution to condemn Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s policy. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can think of nothing more disgusting, in all the years I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been in Congress, than what this president is allowing to happen with the Kurds.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmid reports of Islamic State militants escaping prisons in the area, a U.S. official confirmed that the American forces had been unable to carry out plans to move several dozen high-value detainees to more secure locations,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Karen DeYoung, Dan Lamothe, Missy Ryan and Kareem Fahim report. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne official said that multiple Kurdish-run detention facilities were now unguarded and that the U.S. military believed hundreds of detainees had escaped. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Turkey launched multiple artillery rounds Friday near a U.S. Special Operations outpost in the area, despite knowing its location, officials said. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Although \\xe2\\x80\\x98the Turks gave guarantees to us\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that U.S. forces would not be harmed, [a senior administration] official said, Syrian militias allied with them \\xe2\\x80\\x98are running up and down roads, ambushing and attacking vehicles,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 putting American forces \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as well as civilians \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in danger even as they withdraw. The militias, known as the Free Syrian Army, \\xe2\\x80\\x98are crazy and not reliable.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome of the Special Forces officers who battled alongside the Kurds say they feel deep remorse at orders to abandon their allies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the New York Times reports. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey trusted us, and we broke that trust,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one Army officer who has worked alongside the Kurds in northern Syria. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a stain on the American conscience.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Another officer who also served in northern Syria added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m ashamed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is blood on Trump\\'s hands for abandoning our Kurdish allies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said retired Marine general John Allen. The four-star general who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan and served as President Barack Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS told CNN that this weekend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s events were \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccompletely foreseeable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d after the U.S. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreenlighted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Turkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incursion. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was no chance Erdogan would keep his promise, and full-blown ethnic cleansing is underway by Turkish supported militias,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Allen, who endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is what happens when Trump follows his instincts and because of his alignment with autocrats.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Trump faced bipartisan congressional criticism on the Sunday shows for his Syria decision. Felicia Sonmez reports: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), an Air Force veteran who was a pilot in Iraq and Afghanistan, was among the most vocal members of the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s party to condemn the move. \\xe2\\x80\\x98You hear the president and people like Rand Paul talk about endless wars all the time, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kitschy. But actually, we were preventing an endless war,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Kinzinger said [on CBS]. He added that \\xe2\\x80\\x98for me \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as a guy that served in the military and really got into politics because I believe in the role America plays \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to see this yet again, you know, leaving an ally behind ... is disheartening, depressing.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), meanwhile, announced that both chambers are readying a joint resolution urging Trump to reverse his decision.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore Trump gave Saturday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Turkish-linked forces filmed themselves executing a Kurdish captive in Syria. Liz Sly reports: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe most gruesome and explicit of the videos shows Turkish-allied Syrian fighters pumping bursts of automatic fire into the body of a bound man lying on the side of a desert road as a gunman shouts to his comrades to take his phone and film him doing the shooting. Another trembling, handcuffed man crouches on the opposite side of the road as the shooting erupts. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Kill them,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 one man is heard shouting. The video is one of a series of photographs and videos posted on Twitter accounts of the Turkish-backed rebel groups and circulated by the [SDF] that suggest some of the Syrian rebels participating in Turkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offensive to capture territory in Syria might have committed war crimes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Connecting the dots: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe uproar in Washington over President Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s corruption in Ukraine and malfeasance in Syria has obscured a broader story,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d writes deputy editorial page editor Jackson Diehl. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn little more than a month, virtually every other foreign policy initiative the Trump administration has pursued has imploded \\xe2\\x80\\x94 thanks mostly to the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s increasingly unhinged behavior. The unraveling started on Sept. 7, when Trump abruptly announced that he had canceled a previously undisclosed summit with the Afghan Taliban due to be held the next day at Camp David, and shelved a draft peace deal that a State Department special envoy had spent a year negotiating. The immediate result was a spike in violence in Afghanistan \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and at least the temporary shelving of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ambition to pull U.S. troops out of the country before the 2020 election.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA week later, Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x98maximum pressure\\xe2\\x80\\x99 campaign against Iran came undone. Following an Iranian-sponsored attack on a Saudi oil complex, Trump ruled out a military response; instead, he told French President Emmanuel Macron that he was open to a plan to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the United Nations and lift sanctions on his government in return for negotiations. The gambit failed: Rouhani left Trump waiting on a phone line. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust two weeks after the Iran debacle, Trump saw his nuclear negotiations with North Korea crumble \\xe2\\x80\\x94 again. At a meeting in Stockholm, Kim Jong Un\\xe2\\x80\\x99s delegation rejected a U.S. proposal for an incremental deal \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a far cry from the total disarmament Trump once sought \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and walked away, refusing to agree to a date for future talks. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe attempt to oust the socialist government of Venezuela flopped back in April. The plan for the \\xe2\\x80\\x98ultimate deal\\xe2\\x80\\x99 between Israelis and Palestinians has never been released, and Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s point man on that project, Jason Greenblatt, announced his departure last month. True, Trump is still pressing his trade war with China and announced a partial deal on Friday. But most tariffs remain in place and the easy victory over Beijing he once promised is nowhere in sight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost\\'s morning briefing for decision-makers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\\r\\n\\r\\nTyphoon Hagibis put large swaths of Japan underwater. (Kyodo News/AP)\\r\\n\\r\\n-- A typhoon left at least 42 people dead and 15 missing in Japan. Simon Denyer reports: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTyphoon Hagibis, which means \\xe2\\x80\\x98speed\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in the Philippine language Tagalog, tore through Tokyo and large swaths of Japan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main island of Honshu on Saturday, bringing record-breaking rains to many areas. By Sunday, more than 20 rivers in central and northeastern Japan had burst their banks, flooding more than 1,000 homes in cities, towns and villages. At one point, the government advised nearly 8 million people to evacuate. Many ignored the advice and stayed home, but others headed to shelters. Public broadcaster NHK said some died while trying to make their way to shelters, including a 77-year-old woman who fell more than 100 feet to her death during an airlift. NHK reported Monday that 198 people were injured in the storm. The storm sank a Panama-registered cargo ship anchored near Tokyo, killing at least five crew members and leaving three missing, according to local media reports. Around 200,000 homes were without power on Sunday, Japanese media reported.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY:\\r\\n\\r\\n-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said protecting the identity of the first whistleblower who sounded the alarm about Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dealings with Ukraine is the committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprimary interest,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a sign that House Democrats may not press the individual to testify.

Hill, a Trump appointee but also a frequent critic of Putin, helped navigate the U.S. policy with Moscow before leaving the administration this summer. (USA Today)\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Mark Esper, the defense secretary, said the Pentagon will try to comply with a subpoena from committees seeking records related to the U.S. withholding military aid from Ukraine. From the Guardian: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98We will do everything we can to respond to their inquiry,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he said on Fox News Sunday. But Esper warned \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 that Trump and other officials may yet create complications for the compliance before Tuesday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deadline for him to respond.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advisers are back to square one in their search for a new defense lawyer after lobbying rules prohibited former congressman Trey Gowdy from joining the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s defense team. From the Times: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Gowdy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name began circulating on Twitter as the new Trump defender, prompting a number of aides to the president to claim credit privately for the idea of bringing him on board. But by Wednesday evening, aides were distancing themselves from the bungled personnel maneuver, which was made public before all the usual procedural boxes had been checked. Several pointed fingers at Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, suggesting he had botched the rollout. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 As Mr. Mulvaney pushed for Mr. Gowdy, a former House colleague and fellow South Carolinian, he swatted away questions from several aides about whether Mr. Gowdy would be curtailed in his role by lobbying regulations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- A longtime investigative reporter in Nashville grilled Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about Ukraine. He baselessly accused her of working for the Democratic National Committee. Brittany Shammas reports: Nancy Amons \\xe2\\x80\\x9chad just seven minutes to interview [Pompeo] \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 She questioned him about the resignation of one of his senior advisers and the ouster of a U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. She asked three times whether he met with [Giuliani] while in Warsaw, and he refused to say. Undeterred, Amons inquired about text messages showing that U.S. diplomats thought a relationship between Trump and Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s president was contingent upon Ukraine investigating Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s political rivals. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s when Pompeo lost his cool.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Watch the interview here.)\\r\\n\\r\\n-- In case you missed it: The U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, intends to tell Congress this week that the content of a text message he wrote denying a quid pro quo with Ukraine was relayed to him directly by Trump in a phone call. Aaron Davis and John Hudson previewed the ambassador\\xe2\\x80\\x99s planned testimony in the Sunday paper: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSondland plans to tell lawmakers he has no knowledge of whether the president was telling him the truth at that moment. \\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only true that the president said it, not that it was the truth,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the person familiar with Sondland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s planned testimony [who spoke to The Post with his permission] \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSondland is expected to say that for months before the Sept. 9 message, he worked at the direction of [Giuliani] to secure what he would call in another text message the \\xe2\\x80\\x98deliverable\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sought by Trump: a public statement from Ukraine that it would investigate corruption, including mentioning Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, by name. In exchange for the statement, the president would grant Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new president a coveted White House audience. \\xe2\\x80\\x98It was a quid pro quo, but not a corrupt one,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the person familiar with Sondland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s testimony said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSondland appears poised to say that he and other diplomats did not know that the request to mention Burisma was really an effort to impugn the reputations of [former vice president Joe] Biden and his son Hunter, who had served as a Burisma board member. Sondland contends that he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know about the Biden connection until a whistleblower complaint and transcript surfaced in late September. To trust Sondland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s testimony, members of Congress will have to believe Sondland had not seen televised appearances by Giuliani over the spring and summer, or numerous newspaper and magazine articles questioning whether Hunter Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role at Burisma could prove to be a drag on his father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidential campaign.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- The impeachment crisis is shining a spotlight on Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s state of mind. Ashley Parker and Philip Rucker report: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLike an aging rock star, the president is now reprising many of the greatest hits from his hellion days. He has bullied and projected \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at times leveling against others the very charges he faces \\xe2\\x80\\x94 while simultaneously depicting himself as a victim. And he has turned to ominous depictions of America, and in moments sounded an authoritarian tone. ... Staring down impeachment, Trump has seemed to play the role of the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Shakespearean monarch. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Victimization has long been central to Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s political identity, rooting him in the grievance politics of the right and inspiring in his millions of followers a duty to protect the president from any perceived threat. But Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feelings of oppression and persecution have been especially pronounced during the impeachment crisis. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs has long been his habit, Trump has applied derogatory nicknames to his impeachment antagonists. Schiff is \\xe2\\x80\\x98Shifty Schiff,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Pelosi is \\xe2\\x80\\x98Nervous Nancy\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the Republican most outspoken about Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conduct, is \\xe2\\x80\\x98Pompous Senator.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 To Trump, the impeachment probe is evidence of a plot to remove him from office, part of a dystopian alternate reality he is combating with ominous language and dark proclamations. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Schiff has been a particular target of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apocalyptic world view. The president has suggested on Twitter no fewer than four times, for instance, that Schiff might be guilty of treason \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a crime still punishable by death.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHunter Biden arrives in Beijing with his father, then the vice president, in 2013. The younger Biden met with a business partner during the trip and introduced him to the elder Biden. (Ng Han Guan/AP)\\r\\n\\r\\n2020 WATCH:\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Hunter Biden will resign from the board of a Chinese investment company by the end of this month and promises not to do any work for foreign firms if his father is elected president, his lawyer George Mesires said in a statement on Sunday. Michael Kranish and Anna Fifield report: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMesires did not say how much Hunter Biden earned in his work for Burisma [in Ukraine]. Some reports have said he was paid as much as $50,000 a month for a directorship that lasted five years. Mesires said Hunter Biden was paid nothing for his service as a director for the Chinese company and has yet to make a profit from his 2017 purchase of a 10 percent stake in that company, which he said is worth $430,000. ...\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMuch about Hunter Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s China dealings is unknown because many records of the company are not public, and he has declined interview requests to discuss his work for the company. His involvement in the company has its roots in 2012, when his father was running for reelection for vice president. Jonathan Li, a Chinese businessman who would become the chief executive of BHR, was friendly with an American investor named Devon Archer. At the time, Archer was a partner in an investment company with Hunter Biden \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 In 2012, Li visited Archer in New York City to find a suitable investment partner. He met with Archer, who recommended himself. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not clear whether Hunter Biden did anything other than provide a high-profile name \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and a connection to the vice president of the United States \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that might lure investors. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe joint venture took months to be finalized, but approval was near when Joe and Hunter Biden arrived aboard Air Force Two in Beijing in December 2013. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 He later summarized his talks with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, by dismissing the notion that China posed an economic threat to the United States. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 The day after the vice president held talks with Xi, he and Hunter were at the hotel where the American delegation stayed. Hunter Biden \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 introduced Li to his father \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Twelve days after the Bidens arrived in Beijing, the BHR business filing was completed. Archer was named vice chairman, and Hunter Biden became a director. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 The other partners included Chinese entities with ties to the communist government, including the Bank of China, one of the biggest state-owned commercial banks in the country.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Joe Biden, speaking on Sunday afternoon to reporters in Iowa, said he did not see the statement from his son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attorney before it was released, but he said he supports it. The former vice president said that his son \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdid not realize\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe appearance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of doing business in Ukraine and China would raise so many questions. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf I am your president,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the elder Biden said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am going to build on the squeaky-clean White House that we had in the Obama-Biden administration.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Biden will face tough questions in tomorrow night\\'s Democratic debate about his son\\'s sketchy buckraking, and Elizabeth Warren is a tempting target because she\\'s surging. But the stakes are probably highest for Bernie Sanders, who has been slipping since his heart attack. Sean Sullivan reports: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cScrutiny of his age and endurance are greater than at any point in his nearly half-century political career. A strong performance could help calm the doubts about his prospects as the oldest candidate in the field, while a weak showing could deal a devastating blow to a campaign that was already slipping.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Warren continues to rise across the early states, drawing even with Biden and Sanders in Iowa, according to a CBS News battlegrounds poll. Meanwhile, voters have said Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response to Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accusations has left them \\xe2\\x80\\x9csomewhat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d satisfied, not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery\\xe2\\x80\\x9d satisfied. Warren is seen as generally better able than Biden to handle Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inevitable attacks, the CBS poll found.\\r\\n\\r\\n-- What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s missing from Warren\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2020 surge? Democratic endorsements, per the Times: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMs. Warren is expected to reveal additional support from Democratic officials this week in conjunction with [Tuesday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s debate] and the release of her smashing third-quarter financial disclosure. Yet her growing crowd sizes, soaring fund-raising and surge to the top of a number of national and early-state polls only shine a brighter light on one of the most revealing elements of this primary: the widening gap between the preferences of many Democratic voters and the lawmakers who represent them. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Just under four months before the leadoff Iowa caucuses she lacks the support of a single governor, big-city mayor or fellow senator outside Massachusetts. She does have the backing of the Working Families Party, an influential liberal group, and yet she also has fewer total endorsements from state legislators in Iowa and New Hampshire than Senator Cory Booker.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- A macabre video of a fake Trump shooting, stabbing and brutally assaulting members of the news media and his political opponents was played at his Miami resort during a conference for his supporters. From the Times: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe video, which includes the logo for Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2020 re-election campaign, comprises a series of internet memes. The most violent clip shows Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head superimposed on the body of a man opening fire inside the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Church of Fake News\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on parishioners who have the faces of his critics or the logos of media organizations superimposed on their bodies. It appears to be an edited scene of a church massacre from the 2014 dark comedy film \\xe2\\x80\\x98Kingsman: The Secret Service.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 The organizer of the event said in a statement on Sunday that the clip had been played at the conference, saying it was part of a \\xe2\\x80\\x98meme exhibit.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 He denounced the video and said his organization was looking into how it was shown at the event. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 A spokesman for Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign said he knew nothing about the video.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Queen made the Trump campaign take down a video that used \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe Will Rock You\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as its soundtrack, days after Prince\\xe2\\x80\\x99s estate publicly criticized Trump for playing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPurple Rain\\xe2\\x80\\x9d during his Minneapolis rally. The video with the Queen song had been viewed more than 1.7 million times before it was removed from Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s official Twitter page. (BuzzFeed News)\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Democrats are struggling to make inroads in rural Virginia in off-year elections. Patricia Sullivan reports from the Shenandoah Valley: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShort of big-money donors, they have pooled resources to share one consultant, who provides individual field plans for each race, coordinates schedules and exchanges policy ideas. The candidates have a polished joint presentation for when they seek funds and volunteers from around the state, including a late-September visit to the deeply blue Arlington County. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 But in this mountainous portion of the commonwealth, where cellphone signals do not always penetrate and the lack of universal broadband vexes residents, the Democrats have a steep climb.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DOMESTIC AGENDA:\\r\\n\\r\\n-- A black woman was fatally shot in her own home by a white Fort Worth police officer who was responding to a call about an open door at the residence. Derek Hawkins reports: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA neighbor told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that he dialed a non-emergency line and requested a welfare check when he noticed that the door was ajar and the lights were on. While searching the outside of the house, police said, an officer saw someone standing near a window. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Perceiving a threat the officer drew his duty weapon and fired one shot striking the person inside the residence,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 police said. Atatiana Jefferson, 28, was pronounced dead at the scene, according to police, who said the officers provided emergency medical care. Body-camera footage released by police Saturday shows two officers walking quietly around the side of the house and peering through two screen doors, then moving down a driveway into a backyard. One officer approaches a closed first-floor window and shines a flashlight inside, then swiftly raises his gun. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Put your hands up! Show me your hands!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he yells. A split-second later, he fires a shot through the window. He does not identify himself as an officer in the footage. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOfficials did not release the officer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name, describing him only as a white male who has been with the department since April 2018. He will be placed on administrative leave pending an investigation, according to the department. The shooting comes at a time when relations between law enforcement and black residents in the Dallas and Fort Worth area are already under strain following the recent trial of Amber Guyger, a white former police officer who shot and killed her unarmed black neighbor, Botham Jean, in 2018. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLee Merritt, a prominent civil rights attorney in the Dallas area who said he is representing Jefferson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family, said the officer never should have opened fire. Jefferson was playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew when she heard what she thought was a prowler outside the bedroom window, Merritt wrote in a Facebook post Saturday. When Jefferson went to the window to see what was happening, he wrote, the officer shot her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Prosecutors are reexamining a killing after the Missouri deputy behind it was charged in another shooting. The deputy, Lauren Michael, received a medal of valor after fatally shooting a man in 2017 who she said was reaching for her Taser. Her retelling is under scrutiny after she was charged last week with felony assault and armed criminal action after shooting an unarmed woman in the back.

(Jeff Stein)\\r\\n\\r\\n-- The first two days of California\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blackouts cost the state economy somewhere between $65 million and $2.5 billion. From the Journal: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Analytics, said a hit of even several hundred million dollars \\xe2\\x80\\x98doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t register in a $3 trillion-a-year economy like California\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 He added that if the blackouts continue on for much longer the economic toll will mount, particularly if businesses feel this will be an endemic problem. PG&E officials won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say how often or how long Californians could face the prospect of blackouts like this one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- California became the first state in the country to mandate later start times at most public schools, a proposal designed to improve educational outcomes by giving students more sleep. From the Los Angeles Times: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe law will take effect over a phased-in period, ultimately requiring middle schools to begin classes at 8 a.m. or later while high schools will start no earlier than 8:30 a.m. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 The American Academy of Pediatrics \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 pointed to studies that found links between later start times, more sleep and better health and school performance among adolescents.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Dozens of death investigations across the country have been complicated or upended because transplantable body parts were taken before an autopsy was performed. From the LA Times: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn multiple cases, coroners have had to guess at the cause of death. Wrongful-death and medical malpractice lawsuits have been thwarted by early tissue harvesting. A death after a fight with police remains unsettled. The procurement process caused changes to bodies that medical examiners mistook as injuries or abuse. In at least one case, a murder charge was dropped. Organ procurement before an investigation has long been legal, provided the coroner agreed. The motivation was to increase the number of [vital organs] needed to extend the lives of Americans waiting for transplants. To raise those numbers, California and other states over the last decade passed laws requiring coroners and medical examiners to \\xe2\\x80\\x98cooperate\\xe2\\x80\\x99 with the companies to \\xe2\\x80\\x98maximize\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the number of organs and tissues taken for transplant.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- The Census Bureau is asking for driver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s license records that typically include citizenship data and has also made a request for information on recipients of government assistance after the Supreme Court blocked plans to include a citizenship question in the 2020 count. From the AP: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe two approaches, documented by The Associated Press, alarm civil rights activists. They caution that inaccuracies in state motor vehicle records make them a poor choice for tracking citizenship, if that is the bureau\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goal, and they see the requests as an extension of earlier efforts that could chill Latino participation in the 2020 Census.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n-- On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments about whether states can prosecute migrants who use other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Social Security numbers to get a job.

(Julien Warnand/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropean leaders said Monday they were facing a direct security peril from Turkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assault on Kurdish positions in Syria, as France scrambled to protect its troops inside the country, Belgium warned that it could face terrorist attacks and European Union foreign ministers voiced frustrations with Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe situation in Syria was turning into a security vortex for European countries that have long played a supporting role for U.S. troops in combat with the Islamic State. President Trump decided late Saturday to pull all U.S. troops from the country within weeks, leaving allies struggling to respond.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany citizens of E.U. countries who joined the Islamic State have also been sitting in Kurdish-controlled prison camps in northeastern Syria. If they are released or break out, it is feared they could return covertly to Europe to carry out strikes after several years of relative quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have magic powers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to stop the Turkish assault, said Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell, who is designated to become the E.U. foreign policy chief later this year. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf the American troops wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have withdrawn, this attack would have been impossible. The American troop withdrawal was a condition in order to make the attack possible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n[European leaders criticize Turkish offensive in Syria as U.S. accelerates pullout]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Washington, Trump responded Monday morning to his critics, writing on Twitter: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEurope had a chance to get their ISIS prisoners, but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want the cost. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Let the USA pay,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 they said.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe theorized that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKurds may be releasing some to get us involved,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d adding: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEasily recaptured by Turkey or European Nations from where many came, but they should move quickly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump concluded: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBig sanctions on Turkey coming! Do people really think we should go to war with NATO Member Turkey? Never ending wars will end!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropean foreign ministers were meeting Monday in Luxembourg to discuss a possible E.U.-wide arms embargo against Turkey in response to the incursion. Already, several of the main European arms producers, including France and Germany, have blocked sales to Ankara.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut some countries were facing more direct military peril. British and French special forces have supported U.S. troops in Syria for years. French President Emmanuel Macron early Monday ordered that measures be taken \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin the coming hours to ensure the security of French military and civilian personnel present in the zone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Macron\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office did not specify whether French troops would pull out entirely, French officials said over the summer that a full U.S. withdrawal would likely require France to depart as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nMacron also said security was being tightened on French soil because of the escape of some Islamic State prisoners from the Syrian prison camps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. pullout also potentially imperils British special forces believed to be deployed to Syria. Britain does not typically comment publicly about the status of its special forces deployments. The Foreign Office did not respond to a request for comment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSmoke rises from the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain, in a picture taken from the Turkish side of the border in Ceylanpinar on Oct. 11, 2019, on the third day of Turkey's military operation against Kurdish forces.

In previous Fox News interviews, he said Trump had shown \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoor judgment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in asking the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden but said nothing has risen to the level of being criminal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anything close to an impeachable offense here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Starr said.

They have helped Giuliani with his investigation of the Bidens.\\r\\n\\r\\nFriday, meanwhile, is the deadline for documents from the White House and Energy Secretary Rick Perry.

Biden said through his lawyer Sunday that will step down from his position as a board director of a Chinese company this month and promised not to do any work for foreign firms if his father, Joe Biden, is elected president.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former vice president has stood by his son and said he would be a part of his presidential campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\n6:45 a.m. Trump renews call to disclose whistleblower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s identify\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump on Monday renewed his call to unmask the whistleblower and seized on comments by Schiff suggesting that House Democrats may not press the anonymous U.S. intelligence official to testify in person before Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn morning tweets, Trump also continued to insist that the whistleblower did not accurately describe the phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens at a time when the United States had withheld military aid to Ukraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, the whistleblower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account closely tracks a rough transcript of the call released by the White House.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAdam Schiff now doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to want the Whistleblower to testify,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump tweeted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNO!

We must determine the Whistleblower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSchiff, who had originally suggested it was important for the whistleblower to provide closed-door testimony, backed off that stance during an appearance Sunday on CBS News\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFace the Nation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGiven that we already have the call record, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need the whistleblower who wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t on the call to tell us what took place during the call,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Schiff said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have the best evidence of that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Monday tweets, Trump also renewed his complaint that Schiff offered an embellished version of the call with Zelensky during a recent hearing. Schiff said that he remarks were intended to be in part parody and that Trump should have recognized that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDemocrat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s game was foiled when we caught Schiff fraudulently making up my Ukraine conversation, when I released the exact conversation Transcript,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump tweeted.\\r\\n\\r\\n6:30 a.m.: Cheney says impeachment a factor in Turkish invasion\\r\\n\\r\\nRep.

But this time, they were treated to their own version of the black hole.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the event happened, many Twitch users reported having trouble using the popular streaming service, with more than 4 million people watching the event. Millions more tuned in on YouTube and Twitter, as well. So what happens next? Epic Games has always been mum about its planned changes. Rumors have swirled that the famous Fortnite map was going to be completely replaced, and given that everything\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now gone, it sounds plausible.

      "b'Like an aging rock star, the president is now reprising many of the greatest hits from his hellion days. He has bullied and projected \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at times leveling against others the very charges he faces \\xe2\\x80\\x94 while simultaneously depicting himself as a victim. And he has turned to ominous depictions of America, and in moments sounded an authoritarian tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s moods flared on Twitter. Five days after the impeachment inquiry began \\xe2\\x80\\x94 on Sunday Sept. 29 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Trump sent forth a torrent four dozen tweets and retweets, making it at the time the third most prolific day of tweeting of his entire presidency. Over nearly 16 hours on Twitter, he suggested that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) be questioned for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFraud & Treason\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and quoted an Evangelical pastor who warned that the impeachment of Trump would \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThen on Friday, Trump passed that previous milestone with 59 total tweets, including 33 in just 20 minutes. All told, in the week before the launch of the inquiry, Trump averaged 18 tweets per day. In the two weeks following the launch, that doubled: On average, Trump was tweeting three dozen times a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis behavior during a news conference with the Finnish president appeared so erratic to some viewers that a hashtag \\xe2\\x80\\x94 #TrumpMeltdown \\xe2\\x80\\x94 began trending on Twitter. Commentary about the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mental fitness ensued.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nStaring down impeachment, Trump has seemed to play the role of the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Shakespearean monarch. At a rally Thursday night in Minneapolis, Trump boasted about his own fortitude in surviving so many scandals.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaising his hand and twirling his fingers to point to his right temple, the president mused, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaybe I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a little different up here. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is a look at the characteristics Trump has displayed \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and the characters he has inhabited \\xe2\\x80\\x94 since impeachment proceedings began.\\r\\n\\r\\nMartyr\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump strode onstage to rapturous applause at a packed arena in Minneapolis Thursday night ostensibly to campaign for reelection in 2020. But he was obsessed instead with the 2016 election, delivering a jeremiad of persecution and self-pity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom Day One, the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election, the election of 2016,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe president cast himself as the ultimate victim of harassment from congressional Democrats, the intelligence community and the media.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can do the greatest things in history, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll make them bad to very bad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump decried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd if I do a neutral, something neutral, it worked out okay, not great, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Give him the electric chair! That was terrible!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nVictimization has long been central to Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s political identity, rooting him in the grievance politics of the right and inspiring in his millions of followers a duty to protect the president from any perceived threat. But Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feelings of oppression and persecution have been especially pronounced during the impeachment crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Trump tells it, he is the victim of a corrupt, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeep state\\xe2\\x80\\x9d whistleblower who, along with other perceived enemies, has orchestrated a broad conspiracy to claim malfeasance in his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which, in the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s estimation, was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperfect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctotally appropriate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe first so-called second hand information \\xe2\\x80\\x98Whistleblower\\xe2\\x80\\x99 got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another \\xe2\\x80\\x98Whistleblower\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info. Meet with Shifty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump tweeted last Saturday, deploying his nickname for Schiff.\\r\\n\\r\\nDriving Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s persecution mentality is his undying frustration that his electoral victory in 2016 is undermined by the fact that Russia interfered to boost his candidacy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was investigated, okay? Me! Me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump told reporters Oct. 4 at the White House. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn my campaign \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I ran, I won. I was [investigated]. You won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that, will you? I was investigated. I was investigated.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHeckler\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was another episode of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cChopper Talk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s freewheeling question-and-answer sessions with reporters before he boards the Marine One helicopter \\xe2\\x80\\x94 only this time the president was especially agitated. He strode back and forth and sliced the air with his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, as Kelly O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Donnell of NBC News asked him to clarify what exactly he was trying to say, Trump gave her The Hand \\xe2\\x80\\x94 five fingers splayed across the lens of her iPhone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gesture was perhaps inadvertent, but the resulting snapshot epitomized Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bullying persona, in which he heckles, belittles and bellows with abandon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs has long been his habit, Trump has applied derogatory nicknames to his impeachment antagonists. Schiff is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShifty Schiff,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pelosi is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNervous Nancy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the Republican most outspoken about Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conduct, is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPompous Senator.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Oct. 2 news conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinist\\xc3\\xb6, Trump acted like a schoolyard bulldozer when Jeff Mason of Reuters pressed him repeatedly on a question he did want to answer: What, specifically, Trump sought from Zelensky during a controversial phone call in which he asked him to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Trump offered a lengthy digression that failed to answer the question, Mason followed up twice. The second time, Trump was curt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you talking to me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mason answered affirmatively, Trump began to badger him, using his perch behind the presidential lectern to order Mason to pose a question to his foreign counterpart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you hear me? Did you hear me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump angrily admonished Mason, before again urging him to switch topics. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAsk this gentleman a question. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be rude.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump went on to berate Mason for being part of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfake news\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccorrupt media.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe president never did answer the original question.\\r\\n\\r\\nAutocrat\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreat and unmatched wisdom,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he is a leader to be obeyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, the president offered that self-assessment in response to criticism of his decision to remove U.S. troops from northern Syria and, in doing so, abandon a longtime critical ally.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done before!),\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump tweeted.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the general sentiment also reflected the often defiant posture Trump has adopted while facing impeachment, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Leader\\xe2\\x80\\x9d tone more associated with an authoritarian regime than a democracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn defending his call with Zelensky, Trump used a similarly autocratic construction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump tweeted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phrase is one with which the president is comfortable; Trump has asserted he has the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabsolute right\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to do something \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including the absolute right to pardon himself \\xe2\\x80\\x94 over a dozen times since taking office.\\r\\n\\r\\nProjectionist\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the Twitterati takeaway of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s news conference with Niinist\\xc3\\xb6 was that the president was having a #TrumpMeltdown, in Twitter parlance, Trump had a different view of the situation: It was Schiff who was imploding.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one point during the East Room event, in response to a question about whether the White House would comply with House subpoenas, Trump accused Schiff of having \\xe2\\x80\\x9csome kind of a mental breakdown.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe repeated the claim several days later at another White House event, this one ostensibly about the U.S.-Japan digital trade agreement. Referring to previous Schiff comments, in which the Democratic chairman summarized the controversial conversation between Trump and Zelensky using mock dialogue, Trump said Schiff had delivered \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca horrible speech\\xe2\\x80\\x9d not based in reality, and concluded: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s having some kind of a breakdown.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tactic is one long-favored by Trump, in which he takes a charge or accusation leveled against him and wields it like a cudgel back on a perceived foe, even in cases where the counterassault may seem hypocritical or preposterous.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow facing impeachment over a problematic call with his Ukrainian counterpart \\xe2\\x80\\x94 where he asked Zelensky to dig up dirt on a political rival as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca favor\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Trump has rejected the notion that his conversation with Zelensky was anything but \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperfect.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Instead, he has accused Biden and his son Hunter of corrupt dealings of their own with Ukraine, despite little evidence of wrongdoing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nFacing the assessment of his own intelligence community that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential elections with the goal of helping elect Trump, the president has frequently rejected that verdict \\xe2\\x80\\x94 while offering a contradictory theory of his own, supported by no evidence: That Ukraine meddled in the 2016 elections, but with the goal of helping the Democrats.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump has even tried to upend impeachment itself, suggesting Pelosi and Schiff should be impeached instead \\xe2\\x80\\x94 never mind that it has been a matter of practice for over two centuries that members of the House and Senate cannot be impeached. He also turned on a member of his own party, Romney, after the Utah senator was critical of him calling on both Ukraine and China to investigate Biden.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c#IMPEACHMITTROMNEY,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump wrote, again suggesting his own potential penance be meted out instead to someone with whom he was feuding.\\r\\n\\r\\nConspiracist\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump decried the impeachment effort against him as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccoup.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He accused the intelligence community whistleblower \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as well as the whistleblower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sources \\xe2\\x80\\x94 of spying on him and committing \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctreason.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He described the impeachment process being run by Pelosi and Schiff as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca totally compromised Kangaroo court.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Trump, the impeachment probe is evidence of a plot to remove him from office, part of a dystopian alternate reality he is combating with ominous language and dark proclamations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump tweeted on Oct. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchiff has been a particular target of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apocalyptic world view. The president has suggested on Twitter no fewer than four times, for instance, that Schiff might be guilty of treason \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a crime still punishable by death.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cArrest for Treason?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump wrote in one missive.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe even brought up the charge while sitting next to the Finnish president, saying of Schiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behavior: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd some people even say it was treason.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump has spread some of his own conspiracy theories, including that he has been investigated by the Australians, British and Italians, among other foreign governments. He has also suggested that contrary to the assessment of his own intelligence community \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which found that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections in an effort to help him \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it was Ukraine that meddled, hoping to help the Democrats.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps most ominously, Trump has warned of a civil war. On Sept. 29 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a day of extreme presidential angst as measured by his near-record output of tweets \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Trump shared with his 65.6 million followers a warning from pastor and televangelist Robert Jeffress from Fox News.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they never will be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn moments, Trump seems to understand the peril he faces \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and acknowledges the differing ways he has responded to the impeachment threat engulfing his presidency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat they did to this country is unthinkable,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said Monday in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lucky that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the president, because I guess \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know why \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a lot of people said very few people could handle it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI sort of thrive on it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he concluded.'\n",

It needs a quorum to function \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and Trump has yet to appoint a fourth commissioner. Weintraub, a Democrat who has chaired the commission three times since her 2002 appointment by President George W.

She won\\'t comment on the specifics of the case against Lev Parnas or Igor Fruman, who also assisted in Rudolph W.

The militias, known as the Free Syrian Army, \\'are crazy and not reliable.\\' At the same time, the official said, the Islamic State is active in the area, and there are reports that Russian and Syrian forces are moving in as well.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Kurds strike a deal: Kurdish forces previously allied with the U.S. concluded that they could no longer count on U.S. forces and needed to reach a pact with the Iran- and Russia-backed government of President Bashar al-Assad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deal that the Syrian Democratic forces made \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill bring forces loyal to Assad back into towns and cities that have been under Kurdish control for seven years,\" our colleagues Liz Sly, Louisa Loveluck, Asser Khattab and Sarah Dadouch write .\\r\\n\\r\\nBackground: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe deal followed three days of negotiations brokered by Russia between the Syrian government and the SDF, which had reached the conclusion that it could no longer count on the United States, its chief ally for the past five years in the fight against the Islamic State, according to a Kurdish intelligence official.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat this means for ISIS: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe fighting has raised concerns that Islamist militants detained in the battle to defeat ISIS could escape, facilitating the reconstitution of the Islamic State,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the New York Times\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ben Hubbard, Charlie Savage, Eric Schmitt and Patrick Kingsley report. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs American troops were redeployed, two American officials said the United States had failed to transfer five dozen \\'high value\\' Islamic State detainees out of the country,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d per the Times.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe don\\'t know how many escaped: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne official said that multiple Kurdish-run detention facilities were now unguarded and that the U.S. military believed hundreds of detainees had escaped,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d our colleagues Karen, Dan, Missy and Kareem report. The Times cites U.S. officials as saying that the Kurds refused to let the retreating U.S. forces take any more ISIS detainees from their makeshift prisons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne official said that multiple Kurdish-run detention facilities were now unguarded and that the U.S. military believed hundreds of detainees had escaped,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d our colleagues Karen, Dan, Missy and Kareem report. The Times cites U.S. officials as saying that the Kurds refused to let the retreating U.S. forces take any more ISIS detainees from their makeshift prisons. But it\\'s too early to tell whether ISIS will be resurgent, according to The Times. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe likelihood ... remains hard to gauge, since the Syrian Kurdish leadership may have exaggerated some incidents to catch the West\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attention.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA US soldier sits atop an armored vehicle during a demonstration by Syrian Kurds earlier this month.

      "b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs you can see, my tweets are pretty passionate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Spanbauer, who uses a different name online, said in an interview, adding that she doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t specifically wish anyone physical harm. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt hits very close to home for me. What the Democrats are doing to our president, to the office and to the people of this country is disgusting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Trump and his allies have aimed increasingly caustic language at Schiff in recent days, the attacks have been echoed by supporters on social media who often take the message a step further \\xe2\\x80\\x94 invoking physical violence against one of the most prominent Democrats overseeing the inquiry that now threatens Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidency.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chain reaction represents a new test of the power of weaponized language to inspire physical violence. Over the summer, Trump faced criticism for employing anti-immigrant rhetoric that was parroted by the man accused of fatally shooting22 people at a Walmart in El Paso in August. In the fall of 2018, an avid Trump supporter mailed pipe bombs to prominent Democrats.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat many of the violent, anti-Schiff messages have in common is the inspiration they appear to draw from the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words, or from the words of his associates and allies in Congress and conservative media.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nA tweet from Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal lawyer, arguing that Schiff should be \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuspended\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was reposted by a user with nearly 50,000 followers who envisioned the congressman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s public hanging in a football stadium. The post remained live as of Sunday.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nA tweet from Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) describing Schiff as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproven liar\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who should be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cheld accountable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was reposted by a user with thousands of followers and a longing for the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgood old days when traitors like Schiff would be hanged by the neck until dead.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It also remained live.\\r\\n\\r\\nA tweet from Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, was reposted by a user with only a small following who envisioned Schiff sitting in front of a firing squad. The post was taken down.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither Giuliani nor Schlapp responded to requests for comment. The White House also did not respond. But a spokeswoman for Scalise defended his rhetoric, saying the Louisiana congressman \\xe2\\x80\\x94 among the victims of a shooting at congressional baseball practice in 2017 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 knows firsthand the consequences of extreme language.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs someone who was targeted by a leftist motivated by violent rhetoric towards Republicans, Whip Scalise is well aware of the dangers of that kind of rhetoric,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lauren Fine, the spokeswoman. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAdam Schiff has a detailed history of using irresponsible, false and accusatory rhetoric throughout Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidency, which is what this tweet simply documents in Schiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own words.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA spokeswoman for Schiff said the security of the congressman and his staff is \\xe2\\x80\\x9calways a top priority,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d declining to go into more detail about specific threats. A spokeswoman for the Capitol Police said authorities consult with individual congressional offices on \\xe2\\x80\\x9csecurity-related matters\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but declined to discuss precautions around the high-stakes impeachment inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most graphic and specific threats against Schiff were quickly scrubbed from Twitter, whose policies prohibit threats of violence as well as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cglorification of violence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d At least one additional tweet was removed after it was flagged for the company by The Washington Post.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nBut much of the vitriol remained. And the violent language also reached beyond Twitter, echoing on platforms such as Facebook and 4chan, a sprawling online agora where hate speech and violent threats are routine. A link to an article about Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accusation of treason against Schiff appearing on a Facebook page called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUSA Patriots for Donald Trump,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which boasts nearly 2 million followers, drew a slew of comments about the congressman being hanged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heightened focus on Schiff reflects the extent to which the former prosecutor and longtime Los Angeles-area congressman has become the b\\xc3\\xaate noire of the Trump movement since becoming the de facto head of the investigation of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s efforts to enlist Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s help in damaging former vice president Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate. Schiff has come under criticism from Trump and congressional Republicans as they seek to delegitimize the inquiry by portraying it as tainted by political bias. The nub of the criticism of Schiff is that he spoofed the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s call with his Ukrainian counterpart during a congressional hearing and that he made misleading statements about the nature of his prior knowledge of the initial whistleblower complaint.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAnalysts say the pattern resulting in the violent rhetoric targeting Schiff makes evident the radicalizing effect of social media, which Trump uses to incite his followers against his perceived enemies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhole online communities are forming around these sentiments, like MAGA,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Amarnath Amarasingam, an expert on political violence and an assistant professor at Queen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s University in Kingston, Ontario, referring to Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign slogan. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe online social movement of Trump supporters is very real, and a cohort of that movement has come out and said they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re ready to take up arms when needed. This is something a few of us have been worried about for some time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe web is where the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hold over his supporters comes into sharpest focus, the extremism researcher said. On Twitter, his opinions \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and his disparaging views of other politicians \\xe2\\x80\\x94 are received uncritically, Amarasingam added, giving Trump enormous power over his followers and \\xe2\\x80\\x9csetting the stage for violence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Trump critics have also used sharp language online, including accusing the president of treason and noting the maximum penalty: death.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s treason, pure and simple, and the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who is challenging Trump for the Republican nomination, said last month on MSNBC of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s phone call with the Ukrainian president. The comment was tweeted by a reporter, and retweeted by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.).\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz,), who was shot in the head in an assassination attempt in 2011, said the responsibility of politicians to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cseek the truth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctreat their fellow Americans with respect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was heightened \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin charged times.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nGlobally, public figures are not living up to that responsibility, said Jacob Davey, senior research manager at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a U.K.-based think tank dedicated to countering extremism and polarization. The result is increasing online radicalization \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not just in the Middle East and Northern Africa, long the focus of extremism research, but also in the heart of the West.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial media, he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas undoubtedly made engaging in such behavior easier than ever before, with users escaping the legal and social repercussions of their actions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to craft an alternate universe for his supporters, in which he is the victim of lawless Democrats, rests on an unregulated online ecosystem, where fake news travels faster than the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nSpanbauer, who became dissatisfied with Obama during his first term and voted for his Republican challenger in 2012, said she gets most of her news on Twitter and YouTube. Among those she trusts are Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cof course\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthank God for Tom Fitton\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump, she said, channels her anger at Washington, while speaking directly to his supporters. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wonderful, really, what Trump does on Twitter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Spanbauer, who has worked in retail and sales and struggles, along with her husband, to stay above the federal poverty line.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nBeneath her verdict on Schiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fate, which she acknowledges was hyperbolic, lies a firm conviction that the congressman is guilty of treason.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe impeachment inquiry, she said, is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csupreme insult to our country.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Those leading it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshould be held accountable to the length of the law,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she added. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s treason.

(b) California residents who are registered users of the Services and are under the age of 18 are entitled, in accordance with California law, to request and obtain removal of content and information that they themselves post on the Services. You may request such removal by emailing us at comments@washpost.com. In your request, please provide a description of the material that you want removed and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material, and include your name, email address and/or Washington Post website user name, year of birth, mailing address (including city, state, and zip code), and the subject line \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCalifornia Removal Request\\xe2\\x80\\x9d so that we can process your request.

Some web browsers may transmit \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo-not-track\\xe2\\x80\\x9d signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, the Services currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals. In the meantime, please see Online Tracking & Advertising for additional information about privacy choices that may be available to you with respect to targeted advertising.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational Transfers. The Services are headquartered in the United States.

Cookies are small files that are placed on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer or device so that you can be recognized as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more sites. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:\\r\\n\\r\\nCookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter those credentials each time you visit a Service\\r\\n\\r\\nCookies can help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us see which pages and features visitors access and how much time they spend on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt our Services and provide you with a better experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nCookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t receive the same ad each time you access a Service.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent. If you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies. If you disable browser cookies or flash cookies, it may interfere with the proper functioning of the Services.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeacons. We, along with third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpixels\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal Storage & Other Tracking Technologies. We, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFlash cookies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. We also may use unique identifiers associated with your device, such as mobile ad identifiers. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For HTML5 local storage, the method for disabling HTML5 will vary depending on your browser. For Flash cookies, information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies can be found here.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional Choices With Respect To Targeted Advertising\\r\\n\\r\\nAs described above, we and third parties may use cookies and other tracking technologies to facilitate serving relevant ads to you. For example, these technologies help us determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before, tailor ads to you if you have visited our site before, and avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. You can learn more about certain types of targeted advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance website or our Ad Choices page.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to disabling cookies and other tracking technologies as described above, you may opt-out of receiving targeted advertising from participating ad networks, audience segment providers, ad serving vendors, and other service providers by visiting websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance .\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable tracking technologies in mobile apps.

      "b'\\r\\n\\r\\nMourners attend a funeral for Kurdish political leader Hevrin Khalaf and others in the northeastern Syrian Kurdish town of Derik on Oct. 13. (Delil Souleiman/Afp Via Getty Images)\\r\\n\\r\\nColumnist\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Trump isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the first American leader to turn his back on foreign friends who were counting on U.S. assistance: President Dwight D. Eisenhower did it in Hungary in 1956; President John F. Kennedy in Cuba in 1961; and President Gerald Ford in South Vietnam in 1975. But no previous chief executive has ever sold out the United States\\xe2\\x80\\x99 allies as nonchalantly and unnecessarily as Trump has done with the Syrian Kurds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least with Eisenhower, Kennedy and Ford, there was a good reason they failed to come to the aid of freedom fighters: Doing so would have embroiled the United States in costly conflicts. Trump and his apologists would like to pretend that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also the case today \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that Trump pulled U.S. troops out of northern Syria to avoid a war with Turkey. But there is scant chance that Turkish troops would have invaded northern Syria if U.S. troops were standing in the way. That is why President Recep Tayyip Erdogan asked Trump to move the U.S. forces \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and Trump, for reasons that remain mysterious, obliged. (Trump himself admitted in 2015 that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have a little conflict of interest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because of two Trump Towers in Istanbul.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consequences of the American pullout are proving to be every bit as catastrophic as most observers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own aides \\xe2\\x80\\x94 had feared. On \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFace the Nation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on Sunday, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said that ever since coming to office about two months ago, he had been urging the Turks not to invade Syria. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe cited all the reasons that are now playing out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe biggest being the likely release of ISIS fighters from these camps and prisons, not just that we see a humanitarian crisis emerging.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Esper cited those reasons to the Turks, he surely cited them to Trump as well. But the president wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t listening, as usual. Now Kurds are being slaughtered, and Islamic State detainees are escaping. With chaos all around, Trump had no choice on Sunday but to order most U.S. troops to scuttle out of Syria in a humiliating defeat. Our forces are leaving so fast they could not take with them, as planned, some 60 \\xe2\\x80\\x9chigh value\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Islamic State detainees \\xe2\\x80\\x94 i.e., some of the worst terrorists on the planet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kurds, in turn, had no choice but to invite Syrian regime forces to come to their rescue, thereby handing a massive win not only to Bashar al-Assad but also to his backers in Moscow and Tehran. The one part of Syria that had been under the control of secular moderates \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the Kurds are more progressive on women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rights than anyone in the region aside from the Israelis \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is now being divided between the brutal forces of Assad and Erdogan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Hungarian uprising of 1956, the Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961 and the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, the presidents at the time made somber statements to explain why they did not intervene militarily and to remonstrate over the losses suffered by freedom fighters. Eisenhower, for example, said that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe United States deplores the intervention of Soviet military forces\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe heart of America goes out to the people of Hungary.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump did not express any such concern for the Kurds who have been fighting at America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side against the Islamic State. Instead he took a break from golf to tweet: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you remember two years ago when Iraq was going to fight the Kurds in a different part of Syria. Many people wanted us to fight with the Kurds against Iraq, who we just fought for. I said no, and the Kurds left the fight, twice. Now the same thing is happening with Turkey...... The Kurds and Turkey have been fighting for many years. Turkey considers the PKK the worst terrorists of all. Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them! We are monitoring the situation closely. Endless Wars!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Trump thinks that Iraqi troops fought Kurds in Syria \\xe2\\x80\\x94 rather than around the Iraqi city of Kirkuk \\xe2\\x80\\x94 shows how little he knows about this region. That he is inviting one and all to fight the Kurds (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet them!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) shows how little he cares about American security, American honor or American allies. That he is now maligning his victims by claiming with no evidence that the Kurds are deliberately releasing Islamic State prisoners to force U.S. intervention shows how cruel and dishonest he is.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Republican members of Congress who are apoplectic (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShameful disaster unfolding in Syria,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d tweeted Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming) have no one to blame but themselves. They are the ones who continue to support a president who has been unabashed in his love of dictators, his disdain for human rights and his willingness to betray anyone or anything to advance his own interests.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the time, the costs of the Trump presidency are inchoate \\xe2\\x80\\x94 laws are broken, norms transgressed. But when it came to immigrant children in cages or Kurds in the line of fire, the costs are all too human and horrifying. Are you happy now, Trump supporters? Is all this worth a corporate tax cut?\\r\\n\\r\\nWatch:\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more:\\r\\n\\r\\nAsli Aydintasbas: The Turkish incursion is sowing the seeds of hatred for generations to come\\r\\n\\r\\nIlham Ahmed: We fought ISIS side by side with the Americans.

      "b'We have no idea if the anonymous op-ed writer is still employed, but over the past year, we have seen just how flawed was his or her thinking and how deluded was the decision of hundreds of political appointees to remain in place.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say you are at the State Department. Over the past year, you have seen Trump (backed up fully by his most loyal flunky, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo) abandon the Kurds, ceding domination of the region to Syria, Turkey and Russia. We saw Trump repeatedly invite foreign countries to intervene in our elections and delay aid to Ukraine (with the Russian bear breathing down its neck) to achieve his political aims. Trump, with Pompeo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assistance, has accorded North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un unprecedented legitimacy and now ignores missile tests. Trump allowed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to escape any accountability for his involvement in the gruesome murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and refuses to cut off support for the Saudis\\xe2\\x80\\x99 genocidal war in Yemen. Pompeo refused to protect superb career diplomat Marie Yovanovitch, our ambassador to Ukraine, from a political hit job.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nHow, then, has a political appointee in the State Department protected America? The self-delusion needs to stop. Those who remain enable a corrupt, unfit and disastrous president and his unprincipled secretary of state. Remaining in the halls of power means you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve sacrificed intellectual and moral integrity and remained silent about the dozens, maybe hundreds, of outrages to which you have been witness. Trump has gotten worse on your watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same is true of each and every department and agency in the Trump administration. At the Justice Department, lawyers have been asked to misrepresent the real reason for adding the citizenship question to the census, ignore impeachable conduct by the president in soliciting foreign intervention in our election and support an attorney general traveling the globe to prove a crackpot theory about the 2016 election that would undermine the findings of the intelligence community (including the FBI) and take ludicrous positions in a variety of cases (e.g. eradicating the Affordable Care Act, allowing the president to snatch funds to pay for the wall in contravention of Congress). Remaining at the Justice Department means you will risk your integrity and law license to cater to the whims of an unmoored president and an attorney general who acts like the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawyer, not the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn sum, the delusion of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpreventing even worse things\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9ckeeping the trains running\\xe2\\x80\\x9d needs to end. The president has turned the federal government into a corrupt racket. To participate in it means to enable it and to keep its secrets. It is long past the time to rip the bandage off and reveal the ugly truths embedded in an administration that serves the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s corrupt interests.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more:\\r\\n\\r\\nAD'\n",

Wearing a shapeless brown suit, and unshaven because it tested well with focus groups, he tries to talk his way onto the ballot the only way he knows how \\xe2\\x80\\x94 ambling into public spaces and awkwardly interacting with voters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surprised when black voters don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respond to his promise to make San Bernardino \\xe2\\x80\\x9clike it used to be.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He insists that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a \\xe2\\x80\\x9clegal expert\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because he represented himself at trial.

(The cringe level in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMister America\\xe2\\x80\\x9d approaches the part of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA Perfect Candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when Democratic Virginia Sen. Chuck Robb talks about himself to bored supermarket shoppers.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe decided early on that my candidate wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any political infrastructure or organization around him, which made it very cost-effective; it was just me and my campaign manager, to convey this sort of bleakness, and that there was no chance that this guy is going to win,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Heidecker says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe time\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wasting away, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s losing, and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s drinking in a hotel room.

He spends most of the time arguing with Gregg Turkington, who plays the perpetually ripped-off co-host of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn Cinema,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and showed up to argue that burning down Turkington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s film archive did not, in fact, give him \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbusiness experience.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Rosetti runs an ad against his actual opponent, instead of Heidecker, the candidate is distraught. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want negative press,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explains, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut you want some acknowledge that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in the arena.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIt becomes clear, just a few scenes into the movie, that Heidecker is making a statement about Donald Trump. The president is never mentioned, but Heidecker (the real one) has made dark fun of him for years, recording an album of Trump songs with the only ballad ever written about Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe onion-like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn Cinema\\xe2\\x80\\x9d universe has turned \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHeidecker\\xe2\\x80\\x9d into the star of increasingly deranged, zero-budget action movies called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDecker,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with a hero {Jack Decker) who mutters about making America great again, sings his own patriotic music at karaoke and inevitably becomes president after uncovering a deep-state conspiracy against him.

      "b'Opinion writer\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Barack Obama was president, he had a foreign policy principle that aides described as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do stupid s---.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In large part a reaction to the Iraq War, it was \\xe2\\x80\\x94 despite its seeming simplicity \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a warning to consider the unintended consequences and long-term effects of policy initiatives based on unrealistic ideas, especially about what military action can accomplish. It was an acknowledgment that if the administration isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t careful and thoughtful in the foreign policy decisions it makes, the result can be disaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look too closely at his desire to avoid another Middle East war, you might think President Trump shared the same view. But unfortunately \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as events in northern Syria are now proving \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstupid s---\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s specialty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Turkish invasion of an area controlled by Kurdish forces who were once allies of the United States has demonstrated what can happen when America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s final decision-maker is someone so weak, ignorant and impulsive. It all started with a phone call between President Trump and a foreign leader, which apparently is how many of our most urgent crises now begin.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Trump he was ready to launch the incursion Turkey had long wanted to eliminate the Kurdish forces it views as terrorists, and Trump said he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d stand aside, withdrawing the small number of U.S. forces directly in Turkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s path. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to give Erdogan the green light to invade completely blindsided not just our Kurdish allies but also pretty much everyone in his own government, from the Pentagon to the State Department to Capitol Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Trump decided to remove all American forces from the area, and began vacillating back and forth between making bizarre criticisms of the Kurds to justify his decision (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help us in the Second World War. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help us in Normandy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and threatening to destroy the Turkish economy to punish Erdogan for the invasion that Trump allowed him to undertake.\\r\\n\\r\\nReporting from The Post and other news outlets paints a picture of chaos inside the administration, with Trump being criticized vociferously even by Republican supporters and the government scrambling to deal with unfolding events on the ground. Although Trump was apparently \\xe2\\x80\\x9cheartened\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by the support he has gotten from Fox hosts Tucker Carlson and Lou Dobbs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to get a sense of the coherence of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thinking on this subject, see if you can unpack this tweet he sent Sunday:\\r\\n\\r\\n.....The Kurds and Turkey have been fighting for many years.

The United States has been caught between Turkey, a NATO ally, and the Kurds, whom we have worked with and supported. But our presence there was helping to prevent a conflagration. Anyone could have told Trump \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and indeed, it appears that everyone around him was telling him \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that a quick withdrawal would make things much worse, both in the immediate term for the Kurds and in the long term for U.S. foreign policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long term, however, is not something Trump appears capable of considering, except in his desire to avoid \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEndless Wars!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can agree with Trump on the essential point of not starting conflicts like the Iraq War but still realize that given the depth of American involvement in the Middle East and the complexities on the ground, there are smart ways and stupid ways to extricate ourselves, if that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we choose to do.

We got even more evidence of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deception in the dense report prepared by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III on Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interference in the 2016 election to benefit Trump and try to defeat Hillary Clinton. Mueller laid the groundwork for at least 10 acts of obstruction of justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven with all of that, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s this still-unraveling Ukraine story that makes clear the bits and pieces that we could only imagine with Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pleas to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRussia, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re listening . . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d We have the same threats, lies, subterfuge and obstruction \\xe2\\x80\\x94 only this time, we have the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unambiguous words to Zelensky: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would like you to do us a favor though.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ukraine represents the same lawlessness that propelled Trump over the finish line in 2016: this time in plain sight, with witnesses, including at least one whistleblower and lots of bit players. From the State Department to the Energy Department to the Justice Department and throughout the White House, Trump is using every bit of the machinery of government and personnel at his disposal to strongarm a small country under the heel of its threatening Russian neighbor \\xe2\\x80\\x94 all to get manufactured dirt on a political opponent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s illegal. The evidence is bearing fruit. The time will come. And justice will be served.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal approval rating remains low, though stable, but there is growing support for impeachment \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a Fox News poll this week found that 51 percent support removing Trump from office. Independents, as well as Democrats, mostly support the impeachment inquiry, while Republicans are mostly holding tight. These things may or may not change.\\r\\n\\r\\nEither way, we will be changed if we do not right this ship of democracy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cImpeachment is not about punishment. Impeachment is about cleansing the office. Impeachment is about restoring honor and integrity to the office.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d We should heed these words, spoken by the 1999 version of Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). The fire did not start with Ukraine. Nonetheless, Ukraine may give us the water to finally put it out.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more from Donna F. Edwards's archive.\"\n",

      "b'Nancy Amons, a longtime investigative reporter at Nashville\\xe2\\x80\\x99s WSMV, had just seven minutes to interview Secretary of State Mike Pompeo while he was in town on Friday to speak to a group about religious freedom. So Amons didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t waste any time, telling the secretary that she was going to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstart right away with the tough stuff.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, in an exchange that has been hailed as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgutsy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9crelentless\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca master class in journalism,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Amons pressed Pompeo on the latest news in the controversy involving President Trump and Ukraine. She questioned him about the resignation of one of his senior advisers and the ouster of a U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. She asked three times whether he met with Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani while in Warsaw, and he refused to say.\\r\\n\\r\\nUndeterred, Amons inquired about text messages showing that U.S. diplomats thought a relationship between Trump and Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s president was contingent upon Ukraine investigating Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s political rivals. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s when Pompeo lost his cool.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got your facts wrong,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told Amons, shaking his head. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt sounds like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re working, at least in part, for the Democratic National Committee.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n[Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s envoy to testify that \\xe2\\x80\\x98no quid pro quo\\xe2\\x80\\x99 came from Trump]\\r\\n\\r\\nPompeo was in Nashville to speak at a conference held by the American Association of Christian Counselors. As Marie Yovanovitch, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, testified before Congress that she was ousted because of pressure from Trump, the secretary of state joked to the group that it was \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca heck of a day not to be in Washington.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile in Tennessee, Pompeo sat for interviews with local reporters. Among them was Amons. A 30-year veteran of WSMV, she has produced investigations that led to federal indictments and state inquiries, and told The Washington Post that she \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think of anything else I would want to do, unless it was being a private investigator.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSome speculated that Pompeo was expecting easy questions when he sat down with her.

She opened the interview by welcoming him to Nashville; he smiled while telling her it was good to be there.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Amons was ready to move on from the pleasantries. Holding a stack of notes, she launched into a line of questioning about the resignation of senior Pompeo adviser Michael McKinley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s adding his voice to a number of career diplomats who\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve expressed frustration over what they see as your failure to stand up for government servants \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for servants like Ambassador Yovanovitch who have been caught up in the Ukraine controversy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Amons said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you do enough to defend the ambassador, privately and publicly, against the smear campaign that was being waged against her, and will you speak to that now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, ma\\xe2\\x80\\x99am, you have some of your facts wrong, so you should be careful about things you assert as facts before you state them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pompeo responded. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut more importantly, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m incredibly proud of the work that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done along with my team, other senior leaders at the State Department, to make sure that this institution was functional, preserved and delivering on behalf of America.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMoments later, when Amons pointed out that he and Giuliani were in Warsaw at the same time, and asked whether they met, Pompeo said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about who I meet with.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI went to Warsaw for a particular purpose,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was an important mission. We brought together people all across the world to take down the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest state sponsor of terror, the Islamic Republic of Iran. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I worked on on that mission.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to say whether you met with him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Amons asked, still determined to get an answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I was in Warsaw, I had a singular focus,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pompeo said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy focus was singularly on the work that we have done, effective work, to recover from what the Obama administration has done, which is to underwrite the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest state sponsor of terror. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve stopped that, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making real progress.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt sounds like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to say,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Amons said.\\r\\n\\r\\nPompeo repeated the same line: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I was in Warsaw, we were working diligently to accomplish the mission to take down the terror regime that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inside the Islamic Republic of Iran.

He told her that her phrasing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoes a real disservice to the employees and the team at the United States Department of State.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then he said that the United States has important foreign policy interests in Ukraine, adding that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthreat from Russia is real and this administration, unlike the previous one, is taking those responsibilities very seriously.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAmons wrapped up the interview by giving Pompeo a chance to talk about the reason he came to Nashville.

He thanked her and quickly left \\xe2\\x80\\x94 this time without the banter that had started the meeting. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think he liked me less at the end,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Amons wrote on Twitter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she walked out of the interview, she said she felt as though she had gotten \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca whole lot of nothing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and wondered what she would even report from it.

      "b'Here are some recent headlines from schools around the country: In Indiana, officials played a segment of a 911 call of a teacher in a panic during the Columbine High School shooting to students. In Ohio, officers fired blank shots during an active-shooter drill. In South Carolina, an officer dressed in black posed as an intruder on an unannounced drill. In Michigan, a school is spending $48 million on a renovation that includes curved hallways and hiding niches, in hopes of protecting students from a mass shooting. In Florida, a police officer arrested two 6-year-old students for misdemeanor battery. In Colorado, teachers received buckets and kitty litter for students to use as toilets in case of a prolonged school lockdown.\\r\\n\\r\\nMass shootings, meaning incidents with at least two deaths, in schools are horrifying. But it is highly unlikely that a child would ever witness one. Research indicates that some security measures brought in to make schools safer \\xe2\\x80\\x94 like realistic shooter trainings \\xe2\\x80\\x94 may be causing children more harm than good.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is 10 times more likely that a student will die on the way to school.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur chances of dying in a fire are also much greater \\xe2\\x80\\x94 1 in 1,500. But we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t overreact.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore children have died from lightning strikes than from mass shootings in schools in the past 20 years. Still, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t obsess about them.\\r\\n\\r\\nExactly how common are school shootings?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the two decades since Columbine, there have been 10 mass shootings in schools according to a recent analysis by James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University who has been studying school violence for several decades. In total, 81 people have been killed, 64 of them students. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an average of four deaths per year, three of them students.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven one death is too many. But for perspective, 729 children committed suicide with a firearm in 2017, and 863 were victims of homicides by guns that year.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchool-age children killed by guns 729 suicides in 2017 863 homicides Average killed in school mass shootings each year since 1999 Sources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; average students killed since 1999 by James Alan Fox, Northeastern University.

But very few studies have looked into the efficiency of these drills. One of them concluded that the practice can be helpful to teach students basic safety procedures. But to the author of the study, Jaclyn Schildkraut, an associate professor at the State University of New York at Oswego, there is no point in dramatizing the drills. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll that causes is fear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nRestaurants have 10 times as many homicides as schools.

(Maddie McGarvey/For The Washington Post)\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul Farrell, Jr. was looking through the West Virginia Code a few years ago when he came across a statute saying a county has the legal right to abate a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpublic nuisance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Typically, that would mean things like trash heaps in someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s front yard.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Farrell decided it might also describe prescription opioids.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarrell is a small-city lawyer in a place often described as the epicenter of the opioid crisis. His hometown has been flooded by pills \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca tsunami,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he says. A thousand people have died of drug overdoses here in less than two decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Farrell, 47, made a federal case out of the catastrophe. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now one of three lead attorneys in the national prescription opioid litigation, the biggest and most complicated civil case in U.S. history.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first courtroom showdown is set to begin next week in federal court in Cleveland. Farrell won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t argue the case before the jury. Instead, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the backstage masterminds of the litigation, which now includes more than 2,600 communities. The plaintiffs argue that the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s biggest drug companies \\xe2\\x80\\x94 manufacturers, distributors and retailers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 recklessly peddled opioid painkillers and fueled a wave of addiction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe public nuisance strategy he helped craft has the advantage of requiring abatement \\xe2\\x80\\x94 meaning the drug companies could be required to pour billions of dollars into communities across the nation that have been devastated by the epidemic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey broke it. So they need to fix it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Farrell said of the drug companies. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want them to stop killing people. I want mothers to stop giving birth to babies addicted to opium. I want my friends and my friends\\xe2\\x80\\x99 children to stop overdosing.

But in discussing the case, he tends to talk about his hometown. For him, this big lawsuit is personal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat you see is the shell of the former glory and beauty of the town I grew up with,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Farrell said.\\r\\n\\r\\nA city's resilience\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMarcum Terrace, a Huntington public housing complex that has been the site of many overdoses. (Maddie McGarvey/For The Washington Post)\\r\\n\\r\\nHuntington is intimately acquainted with tragedy. The mayor, Steve Williams, keeps a framed photograph on the wall of his office, directly behind his desk so that anyone speaking to him will see it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the 1970 Marshall University football team.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Nov. 14 of that year, a chartered DC-9 airplane carrying the team home from an away game crashed into a hillside nearly a mile short of the Huntington airport runway. The pilots had misjudged their altitude, possibly due to instrumentation malfunction. All 75 people aboard \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including players, coaches and many prominent citizens who were boosters of the local team \\xe2\\x80\\x94 perished.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat remains the deadliest aviation accident in U.S. sports history. It also remains very much on the minds of the citizens of Huntington. In interviews, public officials often cite the crash when speaking about the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resilience. They say they had to learn to hold up one another in hard times.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpioid pills became popular in the late 1990s, after the medical community embraced pain as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfifth vital sign\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and Purdue Pharma introduced its powerful, slow-release painkiller OxyContin, which the company marketed as less likely to be addictive or abused. People became addicted, and pills became street drugs. When the authorities cracked down, heroin came to town. Then came illicit fentanyl, which was cheaper, more powerful and even deadlier than heroin.\\r\\n\\r\\nFatal overdoses jumped dramatically starting early in this decade. At the peak year of the epidemic, in 2017, Cabell County \\xe2\\x80\\x94 population 96,000 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 experienced 203 fatal drug overdoses.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal leaders are sensitive to Huntington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s image. They point to progress in the past two years: Deaths are down, overdoses are down. A \\xe2\\x80\\x9charm reduction program\\xe2\\x80\\x9d based out of the health department distributes clean needles for intravenous drug users, along with naloxone to combat overdoses. The community has opened a walk-in clinic for people actively using drugs and seeking help. A new program offers residential treatment for women with children or who are pregnant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are no longer the epicenter of the epidemic. We are the city of solutions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Lyn O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Connell, who helps run a new division of addiction sciences at the Marshall University School of Medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarrell and his allies in the big lawsuit envision the drug companies funneling money to places like Huntington over many decades to deal with addiction and recovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Huntington police chief, Hank Dial, noted that violent crime has dropped 26 percent in the past year, and drug use is down. But there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a grim reason for that: So many drug users are dead now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not hanging up a Mission Accomplished banner yet because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still at war here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dial said.\\r\\n\\r\\n'I choose to fight back'\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFarrell prepares to present the latest on the lawsuits to the country commission in Huntington.

Paul Jr., a graduate of Notre Dame and West Virginia University School of Law, decided to strike out on his own rather than be part of the family firm, because, he says, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA whole bunch of Farrells had to die before I could be in charge.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul Jr. is not without ambition. He even ran for president of the United States \\xe2\\x80\\x94 sort of. In 2016, he paid $2,500 to have his name on the ballot for the Democratic primary in West Virginia. He said he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t support either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders because of their position on coal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou cannot shut down our coal mines, brag about it on the campaign trail and then expect me to vote for you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Farrell wrote in an op-ed explaining his quixotic candidacy. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWin or lose, I choose to fight back.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He got a respectable number of votes in coal country and boasts that he came close to the number that would have given him three delegates to the national convention.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s taken on something even more challenging than a presidential race.

      "b'But undisclosed in the study was that NutriRECS, a consortium of about 20 researchers, has also formed a partnership with an arm of Texas A&M University partially funded by the beef industry. The omission is the latest twist in an ongoing debate about how much researchers ought to disclose to the public about potential conflicts of interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April, Johnston announced that the Agriculture and Life Sciences (AgriLife) program at Texas A&M would join the NutriRECS consortium and provide \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgenerous support\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to NutriRECS. AgriLife includes a beef cattle teaching program, educational workshops for cattle ranchers and promotion of Texas beef to consumers. The Texas Beef Checkoff program, an industry marketing arm paid for by the cattle ranchers themselves, has funded a number of AgriLife studies.\\r\\n\\r\\nPatrick Stover, vice chancellor and dean of AgriLife and one of the authors on the Annals study, defended the NutriRECS-AgriLife financial connection. He recently convinced Johnston to move from Dalhousie to the nutrition program at Texas A&M, which included new funding for Johnston and NutriRECS. But Stover says the meat study work had been completed prior to this new funding.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeef, Stover says, represents a tiny fraction of research at AgriLife.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAgriLife has done $170 million in research in 2019, $4.5 million in beef, half of that from federal sources like the USDA, the other half from industry groups. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a small part of our portfolio,\" he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe work very carefully to make sure there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no undue influence from any commodity group on this report.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJohnson did not respond to questions about any beef industry connections but defended the study as providing critical information for people about the health consequences of eating meat. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope you can focus on the bigger picture, including the science and what the public should know about red and processed meat, so that they can make their own decisions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said via email. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou might also look at the intellectual and financial conflicts of our adversaries.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut critics argued the connection should have been disclosed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course that institution [AgriLife] is tightly tied with the cattle industry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health and a staunch critic of the NutriRECS meat study. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is inconceivable that Stover\\xe2\\x80\\x99s involvement in this project was by chance or because Stover had expertise in this area. ... There were clearly huge conflicts of interest that readers should have known about.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Annals of Internal Medicine says it requires authors to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdisclose all active and inactive financial and intellectual interests related to health care,\" though Christine Laine, editor in chief, declined to say whether the NutriRECS\\xe2\\x80\\x99 partnership with AgriLife should have been disclosed. She said that if there was a funding source for this study that was not reported, the journal would have to publish a correction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not aware of any relationship between AgriLife and NutriRECS,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \"Would we retract the paper? No. A lot of the drug trials have industry funding. Conflicts of interest is just one potential source of bias.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nOther concerns have been raised about the study since its publication Sept. 30.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast week, the New York Times published a story that revealed Johnston had not disclosed a conflict of interest on a similar study in 2016 in the Annals of Internal Medicine that aimed to debunk sugar consumption\\xe2\\x80\\x99s association with health risks. The study had been paid for by the International Life Sciences Institute, which has been financially supported by companies such as McDonald\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Cargill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat money was from 2015 so it was outside of the three year period for disclosing competing interests,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Johnston told Times. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have no relationship with them whatsoever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd besides, he said, that has no bearing on a red meat study.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommodity checkoff programs are responsible for familiar ad campaigns such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGot milk?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPork, the other white meat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Collecting $750 million a year from producers to research and promote products, they are overseen by the USDA. These programs are, by law, not permitted to try to influence federal policy. But some experts see that risk in the new meat study, whose title is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnprocessed Red Meat and Processed Meat Consumption: Dietary Guideline Recommendations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Katz, the founding director of the Prevention Research Center at Yale, said the study seems designed to influence the 2020 Dietary Guidelines. Katz says the study is trying to cast doubt on a growing body of negative research on red and processed meat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nKatz says the Annals of Internal Medicine has always represented the highest standards of medical ethics. And while he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe the NutriRECS authors are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cserving some Big Ag master, they are looking for attention. This is about weaponizing science so it blows up understanding rather than advancing it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the study\\xe2\\x80\\x99s other authors, Regina El Dib, is an assistant professor at the Institute of Science and Technology, Estadual Paulista University in Brazil. She has received a S\\xc3\\xa3o Paulo Research Foundation scholarship and funding from the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, institutions supported by JBS S.A., a Brazilian company that is the largest meat processing firm in the world. Brazil is the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest beef exporter, providing 20 percent of total global beef exports.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nReached via email, El Dib said that there is no financial or intellectual conflict of interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cS\\xc3\\xa3o Paulo Research Foundation is also a governmental organization that helps many professors/researchers with their professional scientific career and to conduct their research. I received FAPESP money to spend six months as a visiting professor at Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada last year, mainly, to assist in the development of the systematic review of randomized control trials of red meat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether these funding sources should have been disclosed is a source of debate in the nutrition field.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Sievenpiper, an associate professor in the department of nutrition science at the University of Toronto and one of the authors on a study included as part of the broader Annals paper, says there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of grey area in the interpretation of conflicts of interest. He signed a letter with a larger group of authors that called for the work to be held pending further review, disagreeing with the conclusions and guidelines piece of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndustry funding can pose significant issues that cloud the objectivity of findings,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says David Goldman, chief science advisor for a new documentary called The Game Changers. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhile it would be unreasonable to suggest that industry-funded research shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be allowed, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s absolutely critical that there be full transparency about this funding and any related conflicts of interest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD'\n",

      "b'Talking to the media about an hour after receiving the news, Duflo said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was incredibly humbling, to tell you the truth. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 The three of us stand for hundreds of researchers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who work on global poverty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nobel committee credits the researchers with breaking down large questions about poverty into smaller research questions, such as the best interventions for improving child health, and using field experiments to solve them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1990s, Kremer launched a number of field experiments in western Kenya to improve educational results. Banerjee and Duflo, later performed similar studies, building research methods that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnow entirely dominate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d development economics, according to the Nobel committee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose efforts helped inspire school tutoring programs that have benefited more than 5 million Indian children, for instance, as well as preventive health-care subsidies in a number of countries, the committee said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn just two decades their new experiment-based approach has transformed development economics, which is now a flourishing field of research,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Nobel Prize committee said on Twitter. Later, in a news release, the panel noted that, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDue to their work, field experiments have become development economists\\xe2\\x80\\x99 standard method when investigating the effects of measures to alleviate poverty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three laureates were among the first to attempt to measure the real-world effects of poverty-alleviation efforts in a wide array of areas, including access to credit, preventive health care and the adoption of new technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe researchers also found that even small differences in prices can lead to dramatically different health outcomes, particularly in preventive care. Kremer, for instance, discovered that 75 percent of poor parents would give their children deworming pills for parasitic infections when the medication was free, compared with 18 percent when the medicine cost less than $1, according to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter these findings, the committee said, the World Health Organization recommended that medicine be distributed free to more than 800 million schoolchildren in areas where more than 20 percent have a certain kind of parasitic worm infection.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar efforts by the researchers have suggested that clear incentives and accountability for teachers could reduce absenteeism, finding that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpupils who had teachers on short-term contracts had significantly better test results,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to a news release by the committee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe researchers also conducted an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinitial\\xe2\\x80\\x9d study on microcredit programs, or the giving of small loans, to poor households in the Indian city of Hyderabad. Additionally, the panel cited their work in showing that some poor individuals were more likely to adopt temporary subsidies \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for agriculture improvements such as artificial fertilizer \\xe2\\x80\\x94 rather than if they are permanently on offer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAsked by a reporter what she would do with the winnings, Duflo said she as a child read about how the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, Marie Curie, used her money to buy a gram of the element radium.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI guess we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll talk between the three of us and figure out what is our gram of radium,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Duflo said.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuflo and Banerjee are married, making them at least the sixth such partners to collect Nobel Prizes. Curie and her husband, Pierre Curie, shared the 1903 prize in physics (She won again in 1911, for chemistry). Their daughter, Ir\\xc3\\xa8ne Joliot-Curie, and her husband, Fr\\xc3\\xa9d\\xc3\\xa9ric Joliet, were awarded the chemistry prize in 1935.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD'\n",

      "b'One big reason for the uptick: The uproar over Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s phone call with Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s president on July 25 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in which he urged an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 election rival \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and the ensuing House impeachment inquiry. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve added a new category of claims, Ukraine probe, and in just a few weeks it has topped 250 entries.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, Trump earned his fastest Bottomless Pinocchio ever with his repeated false statement that the whistleblower compliant about the call was inaccurate. The report accurately captured the content of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s call and many other details have been confirmed, yet Trump has repeated this Four Pinocchio claim 29 times. (It takes 20 repeats of a Three or Four Pinocchio claim to merit a Bottomless Pinocchio, and there are now 27 entries.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother false claim \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that Biden forced the resignation of a Ukrainian prosecutor because he was investigating his son Hunter \\xe2\\x80\\x94 just barely missed the cutoff for inclusion. (Trump has said it 18 times.) We presume the falsehood will earn a spot on the Bottomless Pinocchio page in the next update.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump crossed the 10,000 mark on April 26. From the start of his presidency, he has averaged nearly 14 such claims a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost one-fifth of these claims are about immigration, his signature issue \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a percentage that has grown since the government shut down over funding for his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. In fact, his most repeated claim \\xe2\\x80\\x94 218 times \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is that his border wall is being built. Congress balked at funding the concrete barrier he envisioned, so he has tried to pitch bollard fencing and repairs of existing barriers as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca wall.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFalse or misleading claims about trade, the economy and the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign each account for about 10 percent of the total. Claims on those subjects are also among his most repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump has falsely claimed 204 times that the U.S. economy today is the best in history. He began making this claim in June 2018, and it quickly became one of his favorites. The president can certainly brag about the state of the economy, but he runs into trouble when he repeatedly makes a play for the history books. By just about any important measure, the economy today is not doing as well as it did under Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson or Bill Clinton \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or Ulysses S. Grant. Moreover, the economy is beginning to hit the head winds caused by Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trade wars, with the manufacturing sector in an apparent recession.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 171 occasions, he has claimed the United States has \\xe2\\x80\\x9clost\\xe2\\x80\\x9d money on trade deficits. This reflects a basic misunderstanding of economics. Countries do not \\xe2\\x80\\x9close\\xe2\\x80\\x9d money on trade deficits. A trade deficit simply means people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Trade deficits are also affected by macroeconomic factors, such as currencies, economic growth, and savings and investment rates.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump has falsely said 171 times that he passed the biggest tax cut in history. Even before his tax cut was crafted, he promised it would be the biggest in U.S. history \\xe2\\x80\\x94 bigger than Ronald Reagan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in 1981. Reagan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tax cut amounted to 2.9 percent of the gross domestic product, and none of the proposals under consideration came close to that level. Yet Trump persisted in this fiction even when the tax cut was eventually crafted to be the equivalent of 0.9 percent of GDP, making it the eighth-largest tax cut in 100 years. This continues to be an all-purpose applause line at the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rallies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s constant Twitter barrage also adds to his totals. Nearly 20 percent of the false and misleading statements stemmed from his itchy Twitter finger.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s penchant for repeating false claims is demonstrated by the fact that the Fact Checker database has recorded more than 350 instances in which he has repeated a variation of the same claim at least three times.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven as Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fact-free statements proliferate, there is evidence that his approach is failing.\\r\\n\\r\\nFewer than 3 in 10 Americans believe many of his most-common false statements, according to a Washington Post Fact Checker poll published in December. Only among a pool of strong Trump approvers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 about 1 in 6 adults in the survey \\xe2\\x80\\x94 did large majorities accept several, although not all, of his falsehoods as true.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe award-winning database website, created by graphics reporter Leslie Shapiro, has an extremely fast search engine that will quickly locate suspect statements the president has made.

      "b\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAli Reza Ataie at his home in Grand Prairie, Tex. Ali came to the United States from Nauru, a small island in the Pacific, after being denied asylum in Australia. President Trump, in one of his first major phone calls to another world leader, criticized the deal the Obama Administration had made with Australia to take in some of its refugees. (Sergio Flores/for The Washington Post)\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day that President Trump slashed refugee admissions to their lowest level in four decades, the arrival of a dazed traveler at Dallas\\xe2\\x80\\x99s international airport last month offered a quiet rebuke.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newcomer was walking the final steps of an improbable 15,000-mile odyssey. There to greet him were four others who had followed the same epic path to an American life, along with a native-born citizen clutching a hand-drawn, red-and-blue sign: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWelcome to Texas!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNone would have been there had Trump had his way.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a nearly three-year campaign that has encompassed walls, travel bans and the forced separation of children from their parents, the Trump administration has reshaped vast tracts of the U.S. government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approach toward refugees and immigration.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in one of his first attempts to bend policy to his will \\xe2\\x80\\x94 an effort to block the arrival of refugees who had been detained by the Australian government on remote South Pacific islands \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Trump lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI guarantee you they are bad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the president said during a testy exchange with the Australian prime minister a week after his inauguration. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is why they are in prison.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNow more than 600 of them are in the United States, living freely from California to Georgia and dozens of places in between.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter enduring years locked up by Australia for seeking asylum, they are making the most of their second chance \\xe2\\x80\\x94 finding jobs, honing their English and putting down roots in a country half a world away from the one they had intended to reach.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo refugee advocates, their largely successful integration in their new land proves that the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loss has been the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe resettlements have been incredibly smooth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Krish Vignarajah, chief executive of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, whose organization has helped dozens to get started in the United States. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re becoming Americans.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAtaie exits Kabob House, his favorite restaurant in the area, in Arlington, Tex.

Having left home as children and finding only closed doors as they ventured thousands of miles by land, air and sea, they have finally found a home in Texas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were never welcomed anywhere before,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ataie said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut we were welcomed here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey have even become part of the family for Holly Walsh, an Iowa-born, Mississippi-raised flight attendant who the young men affectionately call \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMom.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She, in turn, treats them as sons.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimosity toward refugees \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas been in my face plenty of times, with people saying \\xe2\\x80\\x98Why are you bringing these terrorist-cell groups into our country?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Walsh, who is one of the Dallas area\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most active volunteers in helping refugees to resettle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI say, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Let me just tell you about my boys.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I mean, how can you not love my boys?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nibok refugee settlement on Nauru in 2018; about 120 refugee children and teenagers were living on the island. (Jason Oxenham/AP)\\r\\n\\r\\nA long path to America\\r\\n\\r\\nRefugees detained on the Manus and Nauru islands weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t criminals, as Trump had assumed. But they were treated like they were, held for years amid wretched conditions as a warning to others not to follow their lead.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir origins trace a wide swath of the globe, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Somalia and Myanmar. But they shared a common destination: Australia, where they had intended to escape from war, oppression or poverty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian government disrupted those plans in 2013, enacting a policy of forbidding asylum arrivals by sea. Instead, those arrivals were sent to Manus and Nauru \\xe2\\x80\\x94 tiny islands far from Australia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mainland \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and told they would never be allowed to settle in Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government insisted the policy was meant to discourage dangerous boat journeys that enriched smugglers and cost asylum seekers their lives. Human rights groups countered that it was a cruel measure fueled by xenophobia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe policy change came as the Alis were already en route.\\r\\n\\r\\n[\\xe2\\x80\\x98People just lost hope\\xe2\\x80\\x99: After Australia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s election, asylum seekers attempted suicide]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pair shared much: Both were teenage, firstborn sons whose families opted to send them abroad rather than keep them in a country where they faced ethnic persecution and a war without end. But they had never met in their native Afghanistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey each set off alone. First to India, then Malaysia, then Indonesia. A harrowing days-long sea journey in a rusty fishing boat packed to twice its capacity brought them to Australia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Christmas Island and, they thought, their new lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut instead of entry to Australia, they were given a one-way ticket to Nauru \\xe2\\x80\\x94 an eight-square-mile nation in the Pacific. The rocky land had been long since exhausted by strip mining, and with few other resources to offer, converted into a detention center for Australia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unwanted migrants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe had gone through all of these countries, gone through the ocean. And then we were in prison,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ataie, who was 15 years old when his journey began. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was the most terrible situation of my life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite sweltering temperatures, the detainees were housed in overcrowded tents. They were each given two minutes to shower, and addressed by staff with an alphanumeric code, rather than their names. As desperation grew, some detainees sewed their lips shut in protest. Others committed suicide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEverything I had heard indicated that the situation was very grim,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Anne Richard, who was then the Obama administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s point person for refugee policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidency came to an end in late 2016, and as the global population of displaced people swelled to record numbers, the administration was looking for ways to accept more refugees. It also wanted to encourage other nations to do the same.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Children in Australia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offshore migrant center are so distraught, some have attempted suicide]\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard struck a deal with the Australians that fall that was intended to accomplish both: The United States would accept up to 1,250 refugees from Nauru and Manus if the Australians took in more people from other parts of the globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Nauru, the deal offered a rare dose of hope.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs soon as I heard about it, I signed up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hesar said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAtaie was more skeptical. He wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure the United States would actually follow through.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Trump was elected, and the transcript of his combative call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was published in The Washington Post.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s agreement, Trump told his Australian counterpart, was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdisgusting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d What if the next Boston marathon bomber was among the refugees, he asked?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are not going to be wonderful people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the president fumed before abruptly ending the call.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross the globe, in Nauru, a familiar despair returned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI stopped dreaming about what life would look like in the United States,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ataie said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut both Alis kept going with a process for screening refugees that Trump had dubbed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cextreme vetting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In interviews, every moment of their lives was reconstructed. The investigators homed in on possible inconsistencies. Medical and background checks followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter more than a year, they got approval. But they still didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know for sure that Trump would let them in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought, \\xe2\\x80\\x98We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re either going to be the luckiest people because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get out, or the unluckiest because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have everything done and then we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll sit in Nauru,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ataie said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven when they gave us a flight date, we were like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Is it going to happen?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hesar added.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Feb. 11 last year, they left Nauru for the first time in four years. Under intense pressure from the Australians to uphold the agreement \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca deal is a deal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Turnbull had told Trump \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the president had relented.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRefugees on the island of Nauru in September 2018. (Jason Oxenham/AP)\\r\\n\\r\\n'Welcome to Dallas'\\r\\n\\r\\nAtaie and Hesar had educated themselves about Texas by watching vintage cowboy movies. When they landed in Dallas, they were astonished: Not a 10-gallon hat to be seen, nor any boots with spurs. No horses, even.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they ordered sodas at KFC, the cup was so large they could scarcely wrap their hands around it. A visit to Walmart left them speechless, awed by the scale. But a smile and a few words from the checkout clerk reassured them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWelcome to America,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said upon learning they were newly arrived refugees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had heard in Nauru that some Americans dislike foreigners. But they said they have never experienced hostility firsthand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen people hear that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been to several countries, they say, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it like there?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 They find it interesting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ataie said.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, Ataie and Hesar do their best to fit in and not call attention to their outsider status. During their first few weeks in America, they walked everywhere. Passing motorists would slow down and stare, confused by the sight of pedestrians. Some even stopped to ask if they were okay.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, like the Texans they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fast becoming, they drive everywhere, even if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just to the gym two blocks from their apartment, a comfortable and spotless three-bedroom that they share with three other Afghans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAtaie studies at his home in Grand Prairie, Tex.

Jenny Leahy, an Australian aid worker who lived on Nauru, visited dozens of them in the United States last month \\xe2\\x80\\x94 from San Diego to New York. All were supporting themselves, a fact consistent with studies showing that refugees generate far more in government revenue, through employment and entrepreneurship, than they cost in state services.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re hard workers, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the most honest, generous and considerate people you could ever hope to meet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said as she sipped tea with the Alis at their apartment. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt breaks my heart that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not in Australia.

And with the war still raging, a return to Afghanistan is out of the question.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, they do what they can to keep alive their memories of home. That included a trip to an Afghan restaurant on one recent evening, their first since they left the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nSet in a lonely strip mall where Texan suburbia meets undeveloped prairie, the restaurant featured tables decorated with baseball cards and comic strips \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a dash of Americana in an establishment serving up specialties from central Asia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy mouth is watering already,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Hesar as he pored over a menu stocked with savory beef dumplings known as mantu and delicate potato-filled flatbreads called bolani.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRemember when we tried to make bolani at our place?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Ataie, laughing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe had to take down the smoke alarms.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pair have been teaching themselves how to cook Afghan food via YouTube videos.

But last week, one of the Alis\\xe2\\x80\\x99 last friends there became the latest to land in America.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalsh brought her homemade welcome sign. Ataie wore a black T-shirt with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStraight Outta Nauru\\xe2\\x80\\x9d emblazoned across the front. Three others who had traveled the unlikely path to Dallas, via a detour in the South Pacific, joined in.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one mentioned the news, only hours old, that fewer refugees will be resettled in the United States next year than at any time since 1980.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor long minutes after the flight landed, there was no sign of the newcomer. But then he emerged, smiling, weary from his travels and apologizing for the delay. Jafar Alizada had gotten lost after landing, and came through the wrong door.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis friends hugged him and helped him with his bag \\xe2\\x80\\x94 an average-size backpack, not even full. They had much to discuss: Alizada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s journey, the latest news from Nauru, life in America. But first he needed sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoving quickly, they got into their car, and sped off into the Texas night.\"\n",

      "b'On Oct. 21, after an almost five-month closure, the museum will open yet another major expansion project, adding 40,000 square feet of gallery space for a total of some 166,000 square feet. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve also reconfigured the old galleries and reinstalled the permanent collection.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this growth has come at a cost. When the museum was founded in 1929, it put forth a militant face, arguing by example for a modernist view of the world that eventually encompassed art, architecture and design. But it was always an establishment property, loyal to wealth and wealthy donors, and though the public embraced it, the museum often did things that felt like a betrayal of its larger, public mission. It became a bastion of exclusion, and artists and curators who were not welcome there often worked and organized in opposition to what MoMA stood for, pushing the art world forward even as one of its greatest \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmodern\\xe2\\x80\\x9d institutions held things back.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the latest plans for expansion were unveiled in 2014, MoMA announced it would demolish the former American Folk Art Museum, which it had acquired, designed by the respected firm of Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects (the same group that is working on the design of the Barack Obama presidential center in Chicago). Protest was vigorous but to no avail. MoMA gets what MoMA wants, and a perfectly good building was destroyed to make room for a purpose-built structure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nVisitors to the new campus will be happy for the extra space and the much-improved circulation of the galleries. The expansion, designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro in collaboration with Gensler, includes both a new building where the old Folk Art museum stood and space carved out of the dark, enormous and architecturally dispiriting condominium tower designed by Jean Nouvel at 53 W. 53rd St. (there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a penthouse apartment still available for a mere $63.8 million). Galleries now flow through all three spaces, the old building, the new one and the lower floors of the Nouvel tower.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat means there is less going up and down the escalators than was necessary in the old configuration, and there was nothing quite so depressing as the MoMA escalators. They felt tight, constrained and overcrowded, but it was always easier to take them than to wait for the elevators. If you wanted to see two shows, they were inevitably not just on different floors, but several floors apart. The intellectual energy of the galleries fizzled out in this strangely uncongenial, vertical space that was reminiscent of a shopping mall.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, there is a second way to move between the floors: a capacious steel staircase that floats in a well-lighted column of space facing 53rd Street. That, alone, would make this renovation welcome. But the increase in gallery space also helps bring order to the collection, even as the museum works to mix things up stylistically, chronologically and across disciplinary lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe collection is still roughly arranged by date, with the oldest work (from the late 19th century) on view on the fifth floor, mid-century work on the fourth and the newest material on the second. More gallery space means more options for dealing with light-sensitive material and film and video, which have now been thoroughly integrated into galleries. The museum has also added free galleries on the ground level, a small concession to those put off by the $25 full admission, and a welcome break from the erstwhile hermetic relationship to the street and city beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\nVisitors will enjoy all of this, as well as a new cafe with outdoor seating on the sixth floor, a new metal awning over the 53rd Street entrance, a more open and sensible ticket and entry atrium, reopened windows into the central lobby at the core of the old building, and a double-height \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstudio\\xe2\\x80\\x9d space in the new wing, for performance and installation works.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe museum has also committed to regularly rotating its permanent collection, to get more of it on view and incorporate diverse artists into what was for decades a rigidly canonical approach to display. Every six months, one-third of the collection will be switched out, with the galleries fully refreshed every 18 months.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoMA is billing these changes to the display of the art as the most significant aspect of the expansion. Not only is the museum growing, it is changing its relationship to the art, no longer insisting on a single grand narrative, no longer teaching, but simply opening itself up to exploration and discovery. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe museum is not the place where we are going to give a lesson,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Christophe Cherix, chief curator of drawings and prints, told The Washington Post last summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s radical, and to abandon the idea that the museum serves an educational function would be a disaster. But, though such language may sound good to other museum professionals, the public generally does want a lesson. And despite efforts to abandon \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgrand narratives,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d people generally revert to them, at least to provide a general intellectual skeleton on which to hang their observations and discoveries. Up on the fifth floor, the galleries aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t labeled by the old \\xe2\\x80\\x9cisms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of art history \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Fauvism, expressionism, cubism, surrealism \\xe2\\x80\\x94 though the works are mostly grouped by stylistic or intellectual affinities. Ordinary visitors will probably use their handheld devices to look up and fill in the labels that have been removed, reconstructing the more linear sense of art history that the curators have attempted to dissolve.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the best of MoMA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work over the past decade has been about adding to the larger narrative of modern art, discovering different \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmodernisms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d around the planet and expanding the definition of what qualifies as art. An exhibition of Tarsila do Amaral extended the drama of modernist painting into Brazil, where it flourished, while a display of the sculptures of Bodys Isek Kingelez connected an artist working in the Congo to the larger history of architecture and utopian social thinking. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good to see works from these artists incorporated into the display of the permanent collection.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a difference between complicating narratives and abandoning them. MoMA seems to want to do the latter but can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite bring itself to do so. The rough narrative in the galleries remains broadly chronological, with the stars of its collections still pretty much where you expect to find them. The danger is that the museum will end up with a two-tier system, still dependent on the iconic pieces that visitors demand to see, supplemented by the occasional guests brought in temporarily to complicate things. Even more worrisome is the stated goal of abandoning the didactic function. No one wants a cultural organization that hectors, but they do want to learn. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a question of tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not entirely clear at whom the new installation is aimed: the ordinary visitor who is supposedly demanding to see art without any supporting intellectual apparatus or the more sophisticated audience who will understand why it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interesting to, say, hang a 1967 Faith Ringgold painting near Picasso\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1907 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLes Demoiselles d\\xe2\\x80\\x99Avignon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Some of these juxtapositions are telling and smart; others seem merely clever.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow MoMA faces the same challenge it faced before: how to manage its own success. Like widening highways, which tends to simply induce more traffic, expanding MoMA will only make it more attractive to more people. The new building may handle the crowds well for a while. But MoMA has become one of the great \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwinner takes all\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cultural institutions, and the more it grows, the more it will feel the need to keep growing. And, with that, the pressure to do the big, dumb, crowd-pleasing shows like the terrible 2015 Bjork exhibition will only increase.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt some point, if the institution is to remain genuinely relevant to the discourse of art, it will have to grapple with this cycle and interrupt it. That will mean recommitting to first principles, or at least some principles that reference not just access to art, but the actual experience of thinking about it. MoMA knows how to get people through the door, but no one seems terribly concerned with what happens when they leave. Did their eyeballs simply lounge over lots of intriguing things, or did they learn something?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Museum of Modern Art, at 11 W. 53rd St. in New York, reopens Oct. 21. moma.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD'\n",

      "b'When other inmates saw four guards beating a handcuffed Cheryl Weimar outside the prison compound, they initially thought she was dead. The mentally ill 51-year-old was limp as the male correctional officers delivered the blows, a federal lawsuit alleges. Her head bobbed along the ground, eyes rolled back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Aug. 21 assault at Florida\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Lowell Correctional Institution nearly killed Weimar, and left her a quadriplegic. At the hospital where she has spent the past few weeks, she breathes through a tracheotomy and eats through a tube. She will need round-the-clock medical care for the rest of her life, according to the lawsuit.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Weimar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawyer claims in a new lawsuit, the Florida Department of Corrections is trying to wriggle out of paying for that care. Prison officials are seeking to release the injured woman from their custody early, a move that would free them from covering all her medical bills.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe only reason she needs any sort of medical care for quadriplegia is as a result of their employees,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d attorney Ryan Andrews told The Washington Post. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn my view, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been playing games with her since this happened.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Department of Corrections said it could release only limited information about the incident, which was first reported by the Miami Herald, because it remains under investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe recognize that preliminary reports from this incident are concerning,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mark Inch, secretary of the Corrections Department, said in a statement. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re committed to examining all the details regarding this situation and ensuring appropriate action is taken.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn court filings, the agency has denied wrongdoing and asked the judge to dismiss the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficials have not publicly identified the guards accused of attacking Weimar. Andrews, who filed the most recent lawsuit to force the department to turn over records, said they are still on the job. The Department of Corrections said they have been reassigned to posts that keep them out of contact with inmates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beating was the latest tragedy for Weimar, her attorney said. She showed up at a relative\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house at 6 years old with cigarette burns on her body, he said. She drifted in and out of jail over the years, the Herald reported, arrested on charges including loitering, burglary, prostitution and public drunkenness. At times, she experienced homelessness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe basically spent her whole life on the streets just trying to get by,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Andrews said of Weimar, who is bipolar and has an anxiety disorder.\\r\\n\\r\\n[She began to talk \\xe2\\x80\\x94 then mysteriously fell silent. Months later her parents learned why.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShe landed at Lowell Correctional Institution in 2016. The central Florida women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prison is the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest and country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second-largest, according to the Herald, which has documented deaths, mistreatment and abuse behind its walls. The facility is the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation, the newspaper reported.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeimar was sentenced to serve six years there after pleading no contest to aggravated battery and resisting arrest with violence. The charges stemmed from a 2015 altercation with her ex-boyfriend in Broward County, during which Weimar cut him with a knife.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Aug. 21, about eight months into her sentence, Weimar was on work duty. She was tasked with cleaning toilets, but because of a hip condition, told the guards she couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it. The guards became irate \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and then violent, according to the lawsuit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith a bad hip and nothing more than cleaning supplies, (Weimar) was defenseless,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the suit says.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guards allegedly slammed her to the ground and hit her in the head, neck and back. They dragged her outside, to an area where surveillance cameras couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t record the beating. Other inmates watched in horror and begged other employees to intervene, Andrews said. Some were convinced the guards were beating a dead body.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it was over, one of the prison employees said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe was already disabled; they just disabled her more,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to the lawsuit.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeimar was taken to Memorial Hospital in Jacksonville. She is being treated by medical providers contracted by the Department of Corrections, confined in a medical wing reserved for prisoners.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith credit for time served, Weimar is not scheduled to be released until January 2021, records show. But now, Andrews said, the Department of Corrections is considering seeking a medical release so she gets out sooner. His lawsuit claims department employees persuaded her to sign documents she did not understand, which signed over her disability benefits.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Her case opened the way for people with disabilities to reclaim their freedom. Now, her words open a book that could help countless more.]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Weimar were released, Andrews said, the agency would be responsible for only half of her medical expenses, while Medicare would cover the rest. The change would be made through what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called conditional medical release, a program that allows the Corrections Department to recommend that a commission approve the early release of terminally ill or permanently incapacitated inmates.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrews said he is usually supportive of the concept, which allows the imprisoned a chance to spend time with loved ones while they are dying or disabled. But in this case, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suspicious of the motivation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good faith,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure how much good faith you could possibly have here when your employees do this to her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more:\\r\\n\\r\\nConfessions made him the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history.

Her work focuses on social issues and the shifting of East European identities, hoping to show more than we are usually accustomed to.\\r\\n\\r\\nLes has been working on a project about a Russian family that has adopted multiple children, a practice she says is not that common. As Les says: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnly a few families in Russia adopt children due to possible prejudices of society and the fear of raising traumatized children. Children who grow up in orphanages are often not given adequate psychological and physical care. Former orphans in Russia are often stereotyped as alcoholics, criminals or too stupid to work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLes began her project in 2016 when she met the Morozov family. The family is from the Russian city of Kaliningrad, a former German city that was annexed by Russia in 1945 and is on the Baltic Sea between Poland to the south and Lithuania to the north and east.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time Les photographed the Morozovs, they included 13 adopted brothers and sisters. The Morozovs began adopting children in 2009, after their own children grew up and left the home. The parents, Larisa and Sergey, live with the children in a former kindergarten. According to Les, the family does not have a lot of money, and they receive 8,000 rubles (around $100) subsidy per child per month. The lack of money also makes it difficult to provide an education for the children.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife is difficult for the Morozov family.

Towering over her on the other end was Nyla Rose, 5-foot-7 and 185 pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like David versus Goliath!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a man shouted from his seat.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a classic wrestling story line, pitting size and strength against a plucky underdog. But a nationally televised professional wrestling championship had never before seen anything quite like this.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nNyla Rose is the first openly transgender woman to be signed by a major U.S. wrestling promotion. And here in her hometown of Washington, Rose was competing in the first Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s World Championship on the debut episode of a new show, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDynamite,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from All Elite Wrestling, an upstart promotion that aims to compete with WWE with a message of inclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Rose signed with AEW earlier this year, the company and the wrestler played down her gender identity, focusing the story line on her strength in the ring, her imposing size and her Native American heritage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs her fandom grew, so did the backlash. Angry messages from wrestling fans emerged in online chat rooms and on Twitter threads, bringing the usual outrage that comes from a transgender woman competing in female sports. Even in a sport that is scripted and performative, some still questioned whether Rose\\xe2\\x80\\x99s placement in women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s matches is fair.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m actually a little concerned about how she is with the other wrestlers, because for most of her life, she was stronger, proportionately, by a lot.

With Rose in the ring, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey can see another way someone lives their life. Something they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not normally used to,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said in an interview Wednesday before the show. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo it eventually becomes not a big deal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Rose, fighting in such a major ring, in her hometown, is a big deal. A formally trained actress and martial artist of Oneida heritage, Rose grew up watching wrestling on TV with her grandmother in a lower-middle-class home in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Northwest Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nShe attended T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, where she was on the wrestling team for one week and \\xe2\\x80\\x9chated it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was not as theatrical as I hoped it would be,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought they were going to let me get a crazy costume and get some entrance music and be all flashy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She stuck with the drama club instead and eventually entered the independent wrestling scene to pursue a career that combined her love of both.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always known who I was,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said about her gender identity. But she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t start medically transitioning until she was in her mid-20s, once she had already started wrestling at smaller independent shows.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nShe assumed the wrestling world would reject someone like her. But six years ago, she was given a chance to fight with a promotion owned by Cody Covey, Rose recalled to Sports Illustrated. She decided to tell the owner that she was transgender. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cool; I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care. Can you wrestle?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d After the match, Rose broke down in tears. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor him to have that vote of confidence and just not care, it was in\\xc2\\xadcred\\xc2\\xadibly emotionally overwhelming,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she told Sports Illustrated.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the years that followed, she continued landing spots in independent promotions on the East Coast and in Japan. In February, she signed with All Elite Wrestling.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Wednesday night, she faced a roaring crowd in her hometown.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNyla! Nyla!

She lifted the tiny wrestler up in the air, Riho\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legs kicking around.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one point in the match, Riho kicked Rose out of the ring and tried diving on top of her. But Rose caught her easily in her arms like a baby.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, back in the ring, Riho tried picking up Nyla for a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpower bomb\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but failed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHer body just collapsed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a commentator on the live broadcast said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo shortage of spirit, of pluck, moxy or grit from Riho, but Nyla Rose just with a distinct, overwhelming advantage,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a commentator said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nRiho had been training to be a professional wrestler her entire life. And as she drop-kicked and punched Rose, the fans around the ring got onto their feet. It was clear Riho was the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbabyface\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the match, the crowd favorite.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it was clear that, at least according to the AEW script, Rose\\xe2\\x80\\x99s size didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter all that much after all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe fans are really into this one. . . .

Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Slate, Trump tries to shoot late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), but he is out of bullets. Instead, he uses his gun to deliver a vicious blow to the back of McCain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s neck.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attack continues with Trump going after some of his most prominent detractors.

And it was not an accident. The log, somehow, was thrown or pushed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, authorities say they know who did it: two teenage boys.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two 16-year-old boys were arrested and charged with reckless homicide in Schafer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death last week after detectives received a tip about their involvement, the Hocking County Sheriff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office said in a Thursday statement. The teenagers, who are not being identified because of their ages, admitted their involvement in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cforcing the log over the cliff\\xe2\\x80\\x9d once questioned by authorities, Hocking County assistant prosecutor Jorden Meadows said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arrests come after weeks of authorities pleading with the perpetrators to come forward and witnesses to assist in the investigation.

She and her husband of 21 years, Fritz, were raising four teenagers between the ages of 13 and 19 at the time of her death. Maddie, 16, had learned of her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fatal injury from classmates who called to tell her what happened at the park, Schafer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sister, Catherine Muth, told reporters at a news conference last month. The oldest, 19-year-old John, received the call from his father.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Is she okay?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And he was like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98No, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dead,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\" John recounted in an interview with the Dayton Daily News. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfter that, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really say anything or think at all. I just figured maybe I heard the wrong name on the call, or maybe I was just hearing it wrong.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sept. 3, the day after the tragedy, investigators with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources informed the family that the log did not fall organically from the cliff at Old Man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Cave. It had somehow been \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdislodged,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as John Schafer recounted to the Daily News. At the top of the ledge, investigators discovered the imprint of where the 74-pound log had been, realizing that there was no way the chunk of wood simply could have rolled out of place. Plus, witnesses at the state park that day could recall having seen a group of kids up there.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut for a while, no one came forward to identify them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really need anything, just some answers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fritz Schafer, the photographer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s husband, told WLWT at the time. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI just can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop thinking about her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the essential tip came through.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeadows told the Parkersburg News and Sentinel in West Virginia on Saturday that a mother of a local high school student called the tip line to report that one of the teenage suspects sent a text message saying that \\xe2\\x80\\x9che had done something serious at the park with another kid.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Shortly thereafter, the boys confessed, she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hocking County coroner, Dave Cumin, told the Logan Daily News that the teenagers are accused of attempting to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccause panic or other harm\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in pushing the log off the cliff like \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca projectile.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSchafer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death is one of numerous incidents in which teenagers have allegedly thrown rocks or other objects over a ledge and killed or seriously injured a person. In October 2017, in a case that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still ongoing, five Michigan teens were accused of throwing a rock off an Interstate 75 overpass, striking a 32-year-old man on his way home from work as the rock crashed through the windshield. One teen, Kyle Anger, has already pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is awaiting sentencing.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople have thrown concrete, bricks and paint and even a tripod over bridges, but in some of those cases, such as in the March case of a 33-year-old Texas mom killed by a rock dropped onto her car, the perpetrators were not found.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Schafer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case, her sister, Muth, said that if there were one thing Schafer would have wanted, it would be to raise awareness, ensuring this could never happen to someone else\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loved one again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne thing I know to be true is this: Victoria would simply want the result of all this to be increased safety and awareness at all parks; she\\xe2\\x80\\x99d never have wanted to put these kids\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lives \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or any other person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in danger,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d her friends and family wrote on the page \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFriends of Victoria Schafer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which garnered more than 3,000 supporters since her death last month.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Friday, John Schafer told the Daily News that if his mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death was the result of a bad decision by two teenagers, he would attend their court hearings to urge the judge not to levy a punishment that would ruin their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anybody that understands teenagers making mistakes, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my mom and me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf it was truly just some kids that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know any better or were just being stupid kids, and not anything more than that, I think my mom would understand.\"'\n",

He declined to name the woman out of concern for her safety.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA hospital should be a place where a patient is protected from interrogation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Kennedy, the political director at the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said in an interview. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a Border Patrol agent right there with you while you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting treatment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh-profile incidents in recent years have drawn attention to Border Patrol\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role in hospitals along the U.S.-Mexico border, where agents have allegedly handcuffed asylum seekers to their beds or rushed migrants to the emergency room after they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotten sick in detention.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nLess has been documented about Border Patrol\\xe2\\x80\\x99s place in hospitals elsewhere in the 100-mile \\xe2\\x80\\x9cborder zone,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d where the agency can operate with a heightened kind of authority. That area, which encompasses a majority of the U.S. population, includes any point in the country that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s within 100 miles of a coastline, Canada or Mexico \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including the entirety of states like Florida, Michigan and Massachusetts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the border zone, agents can stop, question, and detain anyone they suspect of having committed immigration violations \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as they seem to have done on Sunday.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman, her ex-husband, and two children were driving home from Haulover Beach Park when they were pulled over by a Border Patrol car, its sirens ringing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon apprehending the woman, Border Patrol took her to nearby Aventura Hospital and Medical Center, less than 30 minutes north of downtown Miami, where an agent insisted on remaining inside Emergency Room No. 26 as she received medical attention. For nearly five hours, the agent stayed put, either inside the room where the woman was being treated, or right outside an open door.\\r\\n\\r\\nA spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which oversees the agency, did not immediately respond to a request for comment early on Monday morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nCBP\\xe2\\x80\\x99s written policies note that its officers, which includes Border Patrol, should call an ambulance when a detainee starts experiencing a medical emergency, such as a heart attack or trouble breathing. At least one agent must follow the ambulance until medical officials decide if they need more attention, according to CBP policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rule provides little clarity about what should happen if and when a detainee is hospitalized. Besides documenting the incident, an agent must \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfollow their operational office\\xe2\\x80\\x99s policies and procedures,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the guidelines say. A detainee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s private medical information must be protected and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdisseminated only to those personnel with a legitimate need to know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKennedy charged that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen. The hospital acted \\xe2\\x80\\x9cirresponsibly\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by allowing the agent to stand inside or so close to the room, he said, and may have violated patient privacy rules under the HIPAA Security Rule.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis woman is under extreme duress,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said he told the officer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHaving a Border Patrol agent right now is not safe for her information.

      "b'On Thursday, four days after he set out on his trek, he made it to his destination \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Winnebago County, Wis. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and was promptly arrested. The teen girl whom Jenkins thought he had been corresponding with was actually an undercover cop.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Oshkosh Northwestern, Jenkins had previously caught the eye of local law enforcement. In 2011, while living in Oshkosh, Wis., he was charged with two counts of repeated first-degree sexual assault after two boys, ages 7 and 8, told police Jenkins had touched them inappropriately and threatened they would get in trouble if they told anyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nJenkins reportedly denied the allegations, telling investigators that the boys were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmaking the whole thing up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but he later pleaded no contest to four counts of child abuse, a reduced charge. He was sentenced to four years of probation and his 360-day jail sentence was stayed, the paper reported.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a police affidavit, Jenkins moved to Whitestown, Ind., after the incident, but he soon came into the crosshairs of law enforcement again. Earlier this month, a deputy with the Winnebago County Sheriff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office, who was working with the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, created a fake Facebook profile, posing as a 14-year-old girl from Neenah, Wis., named \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKylee Marie.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The deputy, who recognized Jenkins from his stint in the Winnebago County Jail, sent the 32-year-old a friend request. Jenkins accepted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two struck up a conversation. Court records filed in the U.S. attorney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office for the Eastern District of Wisconsin show \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKylee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was candid about her supposed age, asking Jenkins, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo u care im 14 and drink?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The 32-year-old replied that he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. When the undercover deputy brought up the issue again, typing \\xe2\\x80\\x9ci dont drive tho im only 14 lol,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jenkins allegedly responded, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYa. At your age I was 15 when I got the first DUI,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d before asking for a photo of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKylee.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAuthorities say that Jenkins soon began expressing interest in meeting the supposed 14-year-old, telling her, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif i had the money i would put u on a bus.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He allegedly told \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKylee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that they could get a house together, and she would be able to drink and party as much as she wanted. She should tell her parents that she was going to spend the next two to three weeks helping out a friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s parents, he suggested, and would call everyday.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cU would be my kid for ever,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jenkins wrote, according to the police affidavit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have people that would take care of it with the paperwork.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation quickly turned sexually explicit, with the 32-year-old requesting nude photographs, police wrote. On Oct. 6, he allegedly asked \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKylee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d if she would like him to come up to Wisconsin and get her. Not long after the undercover cop playing the part of a teenager agreed, Jenkins said he had started walking. He predicted it would take him two to four days to get to her: 108 hours if he walked, 30 hours if he biked.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nHe decided to walk, police say. The arduous trek would have taken him through the farm country surrounding Indianapolis to the industrial southern shore of Lake Michigan, then through Chicago. Along the way, authorities say, he updated \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKylee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on his progress, sending pictures of exit signs and local landmarks such as churches that he passed along the way, and selfies taken during his walk.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not entirely clear how many of the 300-plus miles Jenkins actually covered on foot. According to court documents, he messaged \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKylee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on Thursday, four days after he had started walking, and said he was in Wisconsin. Someone had bought him a bus ticket that got him to Milwaukee, he explained, before telling \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKylee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that he wanted to have 500 kids with her, including one in the next year. When Jenkins arrived in Winnebago County later that same day, an FBI agent and local authorities arrested him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur nation faces an epidemic of child sexual abuse, with the Internet making it too easy for predators to communicate with children across the country,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d U.S. Attorney Matthew D. Krueger said in a Friday statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nJenkins faces charges of using a computer to attempt to persuade, induce or entice a minor to engage in unlawful sexual activity, which comes with a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years and the potential for life in prison. Court records show he has been assigned a federal public defender, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Sunday night.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD'\n",

      "b'\\r\\n\\r\\nMourners attend a funeral for Kurdish political leader Hevrin Khalaf and others in the northeastern Syrian Kurdish town of Derik on Oct. 13. (Delil Souleiman/Afp Via Getty Images)\\r\\n\\r\\nColumnist\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Trump isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the first American leader to turn his back on foreign friends who were counting on U.S. assistance: President Dwight D. Eisenhower did it in Hungary in 1956; President John F. Kennedy in Cuba in 1961; and President Gerald Ford in South Vietnam in 1975. But no previous chief executive has ever sold out the United States\\xe2\\x80\\x99 allies as nonchalantly and unnecessarily as Trump has done with the Syrian Kurds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least with Eisenhower, Kennedy and Ford, there was a good reason they failed to come to the aid of freedom fighters: Doing so would have embroiled the United States in costly conflicts. Trump and his apologists would like to pretend that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also the case today \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that Trump pulled U.S. troops out of northern Syria to avoid a war with Turkey. But there is scant chance that Turkish troops would have invaded northern Syria if U.S. troops were standing in the way. That is why President Recep Tayyip Erdogan asked Trump to move the U.S. forces \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and Trump, for reasons that remain mysterious, obliged. (Trump himself admitted in 2015 that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have a little conflict of interest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because of two Trump Towers in Istanbul.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consequences of the American pullout are proving to be every bit as catastrophic as most observers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own aides \\xe2\\x80\\x94 had feared. On \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFace the Nation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on Sunday, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said that ever since coming to office about two months ago, he had been urging the Turks not to invade Syria. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe cited all the reasons that are now playing out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe biggest being the likely release of ISIS fighters from these camps and prisons, not just that we see a humanitarian crisis emerging.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Esper cited those reasons to the Turks, he surely cited them to Trump as well. But the president wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t listening, as usual. Now Kurds are being slaughtered, and Islamic State detainees are escaping. With chaos all around, Trump had no choice on Sunday but to order most U.S. troops to scuttle out of Syria in a humiliating defeat. Our forces are leaving so fast they could not take with them, as planned, some 60 \\xe2\\x80\\x9chigh value\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Islamic State detainees \\xe2\\x80\\x94 i.e., some of the worst terrorists on the planet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kurds, in turn, had no choice but to invite Syrian regime forces to come to their rescue, thereby handing a massive win not only to Bashar al-Assad but also to his backers in Moscow and Tehran. The one part of Syria that had been under the control of secular moderates \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the Kurds are more progressive on women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rights than anyone in the region aside from the Israelis \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is now being divided between the brutal forces of Assad and Erdogan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Hungarian uprising of 1956, the Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961 and the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, the presidents at the time made somber statements to explain why they did not intervene militarily and to remonstrate over the losses suffered by freedom fighters. Eisenhower, for example, said that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe United States deplores the intervention of Soviet military forces\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe heart of America goes out to the people of Hungary.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump did not express any such concern for the Kurds who have been fighting at America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side against the Islamic State. Instead he took a break from golf to tweet: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you remember two years ago when Iraq was going to fight the Kurds in a different part of Syria. Many people wanted us to fight with the Kurds against Iraq, who we just fought for. I said no, and the Kurds left the fight, twice. Now the same thing is happening with Turkey...... The Kurds and Turkey have been fighting for many years. Turkey considers the PKK the worst terrorists of all. Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them! We are monitoring the situation closely. Endless Wars!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Trump thinks that Iraqi troops fought Kurds in Syria \\xe2\\x80\\x94 rather than around the Iraqi city of Kirkuk \\xe2\\x80\\x94 shows how little he knows about this region. That he is inviting one and all to fight the Kurds (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet them!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) shows how little he cares about American security, American honor or American allies. That he is now maligning his victims by claiming with no evidence that the Kurds are deliberately releasing Islamic State prisoners to force U.S. intervention shows how cruel and dishonest he is.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Republican members of Congress who are apoplectic (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShameful disaster unfolding in Syria,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d tweeted Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming) have no one to blame but themselves. They are the ones who continue to support a president who has been unabashed in his love of dictators, his disdain for human rights and his willingness to betray anyone or anything to advance his own interests.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the time, the costs of the Trump presidency are inchoate \\xe2\\x80\\x94 laws are broken, norms transgressed. But when it came to immigrant children in cages or Kurds in the line of fire, the costs are all too human and horrifying. Are you happy now, Trump supporters?

More than a dozen of the parishioners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 faces are covered by the logos of major media organizations, ranging from PBS to The Washington Post. Rising out of the pews when Trump passes them, some of the churchgoers appear to be yelling at the president, whose face contorts into a scowl.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the shouting intensifies, Trump abruptly stops walking and turns to face the angry mob. He pulls out a black gun from his jacket\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inside pocket and shoots a person edited to represent late actor Peter Fonda, who was a vocal critic of the president, in the head from point-blank range.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, chaos ensues.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump takes down Bloomberg, Vox and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFake News\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in quick succession before shooting Politico.

Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Slate, Trump tries to shoot late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), but he is out of bullets. Instead, he uses his gun to deliver a vicious blow to the back of McCain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s neck.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attack continues with Trump going after some of his most prominent detractors.

Hospitals in Dallas and Houston had grown suspicious and filed reports with the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s child services agency. Child Protective Services removed Christopher and his two half-siblings from Bowen-Wright\\xe2\\x80\\x99s custody in 2017 and closed its case last year.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nFriday was the end of a long legal battle for Christopher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father, Ryan Crawford, who fought Bowen-Wright in court for years over custody and was long skeptical that his son was ill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe was always saying Christopher was sick. Every single week. Every single month,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Crawford told the Star-Telegram in December 2017, shortly after Bowen-Wright was arrested. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe would always say, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Something\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong.

She organized a bike rally for him in 2014, after claiming he had a rare disease called arteriovenous malformation, with the hope of raising $30,000 for medical treatments. In local coverage of that event, Bowen-Wright told CW 33 that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cChristopher has trouble breathing so basically, his lungs \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and body \\xe2\\x80\\x94 doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get the oxygen it needs, so he gets tired; he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t play as long as the normal kids,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how long Christopher will live with AVM.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Bowen-Wright\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trial this year, Suzanne Dakil of the Children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Medical Center in Dallas testified that Christopher often seemed healthier than his mother claimed and that the unnecessary treatments had actually caused medical complications, the NBC affiliate reported.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrawford now has full custody of his son, according to NBC.\\r\\n\\r\\nTexas media reported that Bowen-Wright\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behavior was consistent with a condition known to medical professionals as Munchausen syndrome by proxy, in which one person falsifies another person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s illness and seeks unnecessary treatments for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it was unclear whether Bowen-Wright had been diagnosed with the condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe moment I heard about this case a year and a half ago, it seemed like a particularly severe case of Munchausen by proxy, combined probably with what we called malingering by proxy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Marc Feldman, a distinguished fellow at the American Psychiatric Association and an expert on the condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nFeldman said that in cases of Munchausen by proxy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe mother is not only after attention and sympathy, but government benefits, disability support, medications. They may be after a whole host of tangible gains as well as the attention.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is debate among the psychiatric community about whether the condition is a form of mental illness or a type of abuse, Feldman said, but children who are subjected to it can suffer serious consequences even if the behavior is discovered. Unnecessary medical treatments can do harm or endanger a child. Depression and post-traumatic stress disorder are not uncommon among survivors. An estimated 600 to 1,200 cases occur in the United States each year, according to Feldman.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIt takes an average of 14 to 15 months for a case of Munchausen by proxy to be discovered, and America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decentralized medical system enables perpetrators to bounce from doctor to doctor to avoid suspicion and continue to fabricate stories and diagnoses with each new visit. It is unusual, though, for a parent to take a child to hundreds of different medical visits as Bowen-Wright had, Feldman said, though he added it was not unheard of.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve encountered cases that have gone on for seven, eight, nine years before doctors recognize that it was abuse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more:\\r\\n\\r\\nAD'\n",

Schiff (D-Calif.) be questioned for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFraud & Treason\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and quoted an Evangelical pastor who warned that the impeachment of Trump would \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThen on Friday, Trump passed that previous milestone with 59 total tweets, including 33 in just 20 minutes. All told, in the week before the launch of the inquiry, Trump averaged 18 tweets per day. In the two weeks following the launch, that doubled: On average, Trump was tweeting three dozen times a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis behavior during a news conference with the Finnish president appeared so erratic to some viewers that a hashtag \\xe2\\x80\\x94 #TrumpMeltdown \\xe2\\x80\\x94 began trending on Twitter. Commentary about the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mental fitness ensued.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nStaring down impeachment, Trump has seemed to play the role of the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Shakespearean monarch. At a rally Thursday night in Minneapolis, Trump boasted about his own fortitude in surviving so many scandals.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaising his hand and twirling his fingers to point to his right temple, the president mused, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaybe I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a little different up here. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is a look at the characteristics Trump has displayed \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and the characters he has inhabited \\xe2\\x80\\x94 since impeachment proceedings began.\\r\\n\\r\\nMartyr\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump strode onstage to rapturous applause at a packed arena in Minneapolis Thursday night ostensibly to campaign for reelection in 2020. But he was obsessed instead with the 2016 election, delivering a jeremiad of persecution and self-pity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom Day One, the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election, the election of 2016,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe president cast himself as the ultimate victim of harassment from congressional Democrats, the intelligence community and the media.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can do the greatest things in history, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll make them bad to very bad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump decried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd if I do a neutral, something neutral, it worked out okay, not great, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Give him the electric chair! That was terrible!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nVictimization has long been central to Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s political identity, rooting him in the grievance politics of the right and inspiring in his millions of followers a duty to protect the president from any perceived threat. But Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feelings of oppression and persecution have been especially pronounced during the impeachment crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Trump tells it, he is the victim of a corrupt, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeep state\\xe2\\x80\\x9d whistleblower who, along with other perceived enemies, has orchestrated a broad conspiracy to claim malfeasance in his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which, in the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s estimation, was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperfect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctotally appropriate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe first so-called second hand information \\xe2\\x80\\x98Whistleblower\\xe2\\x80\\x99 got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another \\xe2\\x80\\x98Whistleblower\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info. Meet with Shifty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump tweeted last Saturday, deploying his nickname for Schiff.\\r\\n\\r\\nDriving Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s persecution mentality is his undying frustration that his electoral victory in 2016 is undermined by the fact that Russia interfered to boost his candidacy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was investigated, okay? Me! Me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump told reporters Oct. 4 at the White House. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn my campaign \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I ran, I won. I was [investigated]. You won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that, will you? I was investigated. I was investigated.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHeckler\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was another episode of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cChopper Talk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s freewheeling question-and-answer sessions with reporters before he boards the Marine One helicopter \\xe2\\x80\\x94 only this time the president was especially agitated. He strode back and forth and sliced the air with his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, as Kelly O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Donnell of NBC News asked him to clarify what exactly he was trying to say, Trump gave her The Hand \\xe2\\x80\\x94 five fingers splayed across the lens of her iPhone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gesture was perhaps inadvertent, but the resulting snapshot epitomized Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bullying persona, in which he heckles, belittles and bellows with abandon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs has long been his habit, Trump has applied derogatory nicknames to his impeachment antagonists. Schiff is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShifty Schiff,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pelosi is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNervous Nancy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the Republican most outspoken about Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conduct, is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPompous Senator.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Oct. 2 news conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinist\\xc3\\xb6, Trump acted like a schoolyard bulldozer when Jeff Mason of Reuters pressed him repeatedly on a question he did want to answer: What, specifically, Trump sought from Zelensky during a controversial phone call in which he asked him to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Trump offered a lengthy digression that failed to answer the question, Mason followed up twice. The second time, Trump was curt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you talking to me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mason answered affirmatively, Trump began to badger him, using his perch behind the presidential lectern to order Mason to pose a question to his foreign counterpart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you hear me? Did you hear me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump angrily admonished Mason, before again urging him to switch topics. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAsk this gentleman a question. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be rude.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump went on to berate Mason for being part of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfake news\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccorrupt media.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe president never did answer the original question.\\r\\n\\r\\nAutocrat\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreat and unmatched wisdom,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he is a leader to be obeyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, the president offered that self-assessment in response to criticism of his decision to remove U.S. troops from northern Syria and, in doing so, abandon a longtime critical ally.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done before!),\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump tweeted.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the general sentiment also reflected the often defiant posture Trump has adopted while facing impeachment, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Leader\\xe2\\x80\\x9d tone more associated with an authoritarian regime than a democracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn defending his call with Zelensky, Trump used a similarly autocratic construction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump tweeted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phrase is one with which the president is comfortable; Trump has asserted he has the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabsolute right\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to do something \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including the absolute right to pardon himself \\xe2\\x80\\x94 over a dozen times since taking office.\\r\\n\\r\\nProjectionist\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the Twitterati takeaway of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s news conference with Niinist\\xc3\\xb6 was that the president was having a #TrumpMeltdown, in Twitter parlance, Trump had a different view of the situation: It was Schiff who was imploding.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one point during the East Room event, in response to a question about whether the White House would comply with House subpoenas, Trump accused Schiff of having \\xe2\\x80\\x9csome kind of a mental breakdown.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe repeated the claim several days later at another White House event, this one ostensibly about the U.S.-Japan digital trade agreement. Referring to previous Schiff comments, in which the Democratic chairman summarized the controversial conversation between Trump and Zelensky using mock dialogue, Trump said Schiff had delivered \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca horrible speech\\xe2\\x80\\x9d not based in reality, and concluded: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s having some kind of a breakdown.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tactic is one long-favored by Trump, in which he takes a charge or accusation leveled against him and wields it like a cudgel back on a perceived foe, even in cases where the counterassault may seem hypocritical or preposterous.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow facing impeachment over a problematic call with his Ukrainian counterpart \\xe2\\x80\\x94 where he asked Zelensky to dig up dirt on a political rival as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca favor\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Trump has rejected the notion that his conversation with Zelensky was anything but \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperfect.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Instead, he has accused Biden and his son Hunter of corrupt dealings of their own with Ukraine, despite little evidence of wrongdoing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nFacing the assessment of his own intelligence community that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential elections with the goal of helping elect Trump, the president has frequently rejected that verdict \\xe2\\x80\\x94 while offering a contradictory theory of his own, supported by no evidence: That Ukraine meddled in the 2016 elections, but with the goal of helping the Democrats.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump has even tried to upend impeachment itself, suggesting Pelosi and Schiff should be impeached instead \\xe2\\x80\\x94 never mind that it has been a matter of practice for over two centuries that members of the House and Senate cannot be impeached. He also turned on a member of his own party, Romney, after the Utah senator was critical of him calling on both Ukraine and China to investigate Biden.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c#IMPEACHMITTROMNEY,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump wrote, again suggesting his own potential penance be meted out instead to someone with whom he was feuding.\\r\\n\\r\\nConspiracist\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump decried the impeachment effort against him as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccoup.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He accused the intelligence community whistleblower \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as well as the whistleblower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sources \\xe2\\x80\\x94 of spying on him and committing \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctreason.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He described the impeachment process being run by Pelosi and Schiff as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca totally compromised Kangaroo court.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Trump, the impeachment probe is evidence of a plot to remove him from office, part of a dystopian alternate reality he is combating with ominous language and dark proclamations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs I learn more and more each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump tweeted on Oct. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchiff has been a particular target of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apocalyptic world view. The president has suggested on Twitter no fewer than four times, for instance, that Schiff might be guilty of treason \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a crime still punishable by death.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cArrest for Treason?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump wrote in one missive.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe even brought up the charge while sitting next to the Finnish president, saying of Schiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behavior: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd some people even say it was treason.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump has spread some of his own conspiracy theories, including that he has been investigated by the Australians, British and Italians, among other foreign governments. He has also suggested that contrary to the assessment of his own intelligence community \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which found that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections in an effort to help him \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it was Ukraine that meddled, hoping to help the Democrats.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps most ominously, Trump has warned of a civil war. On Sept. 29 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a day of extreme presidential angst as measured by his near-record output of tweets \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Trump shared with his 65.6 million followers a warning from pastor and televangelist Robert Jeffress from Fox News.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they never will be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn moments, Trump seems to understand the peril he faces \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and acknowledges the differing ways he has responded to the impeachment threat engulfing his presidency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat they did to this country is unthinkable,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said Monday in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lucky that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the president, because I guess \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know why \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a lot of people said very few people could handle it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI sort of thrive on it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he concluded.'\n",

The site\\xe2\\x80\\x99s creator, a user known by his Internet handle, Carpe Donktum, scored an Oval Office meeting in July with Trump, who reportedly welcomed him as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgenius.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nCarpe Donktum confirmed in a Twitter message Sunday to The Washington Post that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe creator of the video is, and will remain a contributor to my site MemeWorld.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Carpe Donktum declined to identify the video\\xe2\\x80\\x99s creator citing concerns that the person may face online or in-person harassment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAlex Phillips, organizer of the American Priority Festival and Conference, told the Times the video was played at one point during the three-day event that began Thursday as part of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmeme exhibit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The violent parody was included in a meme compilation that also featured Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2020 reelection campaign logo, according to the Times.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt has come to our attention that an unauthorized video was shown in a side room at #AMPFest19,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a statement posted to the conference\\xe2\\x80\\x99s website said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis video was not approved, seen, or sanctioned by the #AMPFest19 organizers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe statement went on to note that the conference \\xe2\\x80\\x9calways has and always will condemn political violence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPhillips told the Times the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmatter is under review.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a statement to The Post early Monday, the Trump campaign distanced itself from the video.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople close to Trump, such as former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and Donald Trump Jr., were also scheduled to speak at the conference and told the Times they were not aware of the edited footage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe video\\xe2\\x80\\x99s massacre scene opens with the Trump figure walking down the center aisle of a packed church. More than a dozen of the parishioners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 faces are covered by the logos of major media organizations, ranging from PBS to The Washington Post. Rising out of the pews when Trump passes them, some of the churchgoers appear to be yelling at the president, whose face contorts into a scowl.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the shouting intensifies, Trump abruptly stops walking and turns to face the angry mob. He pulls out a black gun from his jacket\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inside pocket and shoots a person edited to represent late actor Peter Fonda, who was a vocal critic of the president, in the head from point-blank range.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, chaos ensues.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump takes down Bloomberg, Vox and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFake News\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in quick succession before shooting Politico. At one point, he grabs someone who represents the Black Lives Matter movement in a chokehold and shoots that person in the head.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter shooting MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, Vice News, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Slate, Trump tries to shoot late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), but he is out of bullets. Instead, he uses his gun to deliver a vicious blow to the back of McCain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s neck.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attack continues with Trump going after some of his most prominent detractors.

But I was not afraid.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nChujfi and his wife Juliana Gonz\\xc3\\xa1lez both grew up in Pereira, a mountainous coffee region in Colombia (although they actually met later, after they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d both left). He moved to Germany for a job as a systems engineer; back in Colombia, Gonz\\xc3\\xa1lez worked in strategic communications with a background in international affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, following her heart, Gonz\\xc3\\xa1lez joined Chujfi in 2002. They both fell in love with the richness of Berlin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history and the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s potential. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t an easy path\\xe2\\x80\\x94Colombia is thousands of miles from Germany, in all kinds of ways\\xe2\\x80\\x94but they were determined.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to learn German, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care how long it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to take,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Gonz\\xc3\\xa1lez recalls. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was just trying to realize, \\xe2\\x80\\x98who am I in this new place,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and defining myself, that took more time. The first years were very confusing for me, but language was my vehicle to move forward.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, yes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Chujfi echoes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the best decision anyone can make.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nChujfi eventually launched his own innovative telecommunications company, Sabienzia; he strongly believes \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrustable technology is made in Germany\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Gonz\\xc3\\xa1lez found a job as a producer in the Spanish department of broadcaster Deutsche Welle and later worked as the deputy chief of mission at the Colombian embassy. Their two daughters, Hanna and Claire, were born in Berlin and now ping-pong fluently between Spanish, German, and English.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut two years ago, the family faced a tough decision of whether to return to Colombia. Gonz\\xc3\\xa1lez\\xe2\\x80\\x99s embassy work was putting her in very close contact with the politics and affairs in her home country, and her passion about these matters made her wonder whether it would be better to simply go back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI felt like I was in the middle of a bridge, and I wondered whether I should cross that bridge or take a step back and remain here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Chujfi had a successful business to run, and Gonz\\xc3\\xa1lez was welcomed back to Deutsche Welle, where she is now a political correspondent.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, it was their lifestyle that kept them in Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can ride my bike to the office, I can drop the kids off at school. You work, but you also have a fulfilled life,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Gonz\\xc3\\xa1lez says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt gives me a sense of freedom, of security. Those little but significant details make me happy and enrich me\\xe2\\x80\\x94the small stuff is so important.

She had been camping with a friend in Paris and applying to a slew of startup jobs in Berlin with no luck. And then, on the day her train was leaving for Berlin, she received an email about a Skype interview for a marketing position in a housing rental startup. She was hired on the spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ex-Parisian arrived in the city in the winter of 2014 after deciding to quit the French capital. A six-month Erasmus exchange program in Oslo where she reveled in an international cohort had opened her eyes to the world, and she couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t face working in Paris after going back to complete her studies there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI started feeling repressed there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Roux recalls. She had studied political science and communications at the Paris-Sorbonne University and interned at the European Parliament in France.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I started to have this other image for myself, of someone doing something completely different than working for a political party or for French institutions. I came to Berlin really without a plan\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was a complete coup de t\\xc3\\xaate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Berlin she did a Weiterbildung\\xe2\\x80\\x94German for \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctraineeship\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94in website conception and online communication, and decided to forge her own way as freelancer. She now builds online communication strategies for small companies in Berlin and France.\\r\\n\\r\\nA typical weekday for Roux starts with breakfast with her boyfriend\\xe2\\x80\\x94a German artist\\xe2\\x80\\x94and listening to her favorite French radio show. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know I should listen to German programs, but I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t skip my mother tongue in the mornings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she works from home in Friedrichshain, a young, bustling neighborhood on Berlin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eastern flank, before heading out for a few client meetings in the afternoon. The evenings are devoted to German class or an art exhibition and dinner in one of the neighborhood\\xe2\\x80\\x99s many restaurants.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeekends have gotten a lot more wholesome. Roux used to explore Berlin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s club scene, but these days\\xe2\\x80\\x94particularly during the summer\\xe2\\x80\\x94her favorite thing to do is take her bike to one of the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s myriad lakes and picnic all afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m really a lake freak,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so beautiful to have so many lakes around Berlin. I feel so much more connected to nature here than I ever was in Paris.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, she misses home, but she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s convinced she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s found her personal island in the German capital.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI also could have a very beautiful life in France,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut in Paris, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just much more coded; if you want to get your baguette, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go in your pajamas. I feel much better, much freer here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nManuel Pessao de Lima\\r\\n\\r\\nJust arrived\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a pianist performer-composer, Manuel Pessao de Lima has always valued experimentation. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s this personal mandate that pulled him to Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter finishing his doctorate in musical arts in 2016 at the California Institute of the Arts, where he was also a lecturer, Lima moved back to his parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 house in his native Brazil. By 2019 his compositional repertoire already included pieces for dance, theater, cinema installations and orchestra, but he found teaching was the only sustainable way to make a living.\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually two things became clear: he had to leave the academic world, and he had to leave Brazil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI always felt really trapped inside the university,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lima says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn Brazil, academia is very much based on a conservative French model. And you have a strong divide: either you have an academic career, or you have an artistic career, which is a whole other world.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, the political climate back home was deteriorating; Jair Bolsonaro was rising to power, and once in office, he began cutting budgets from the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top universities. Lima was pessimistic. He had three concerts in Europe, and he took the chance to visit Berlin and see if it was a place where he could find a haven.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhenever you have a situation like this, you have resistance\\xe2\\x80\\x94there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more engagement from people from the left, from artists and intellectuals, and that can be empowering,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d already felt displaced. I studied abroad and had been gone for so long.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMoving to Berlin offered Lima a kind of personal liberation. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a theme that resonates deeply within his work, which engages heavily with the notions of failure and vulnerability. And the experimental music scene here was exactly what he was searching for.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the perfect setting to experiment [with] this liberation I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in need of to be reborn artistically,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lima says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeing a classical pianist is a very Olympic career. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re always dealing with a very high standard. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even have a piano here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nLima is still getting settled. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s looking for long-term housing, which can be a Herculean task these days in the city, but he harbors high hopes for the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI just really want to exist as a living artist, which is having some sort of living interaction with the present reality.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nJoin the wave of talented people moving to Berlin.\\r\\n\\r\\n[LEARN MORE]'\n",

      "b'\\r\\n\\r\\nAn engraving by Theodor de Bry depicting Christopher Columbus landing on Hispaniola on Dec. 6, 1492. (Theodor de Bry/Library of Congress)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lucayan did not know it was Oct. 12, 1492. They did not know that their island, in what would become the Bahamas, had been spotted by Spanish explorers led by a Genoese man named Christopher Columbus. And they did not know that in less than 30 years, their island would be empty from the coming genocide.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Columbus and his men approached, the Lucayans greeted them warmly, offering food and water, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe understood that they had asked us if we had come from heaven,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Columbus wrote in his journal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith 50 men they can all be subjugated and made to do what is required of them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of them, he noticed, were wearing gold nose rings.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Christopher Columbus and the potato that changed the world]\\r\\n\\r\\nColumbus and his crew stayed just long enough to kidnap a few inhabitants, before sailing away to explore other islands filled with indigenous people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year the District of Columbia joins at least five states and dozens of cities and counties in replacing Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Day. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part of a decades-long reckoning with the sanitized version of the European colonization of the Americas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Hispaniola \\xe2\\x80\\x94 what is now Haiti and the Dominican Republic \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Columbus encountered the Lucayans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cousins, the Ta\\xc3\\xadno. (The Lucayan were a branch of the much larger Ta\\xc3\\xadno, who were part of the Arawak language group.) Historians disagree on how many Ta\\xc3\\xadno lived on Hispaniola at the time, with estimates ranging from 60,000 to 8 million. One contemporaneous account from Bartolom\\xc3\\xa9 de las Casas claimed there were 3 million. More about las Casas shortly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere Columbus built a fort where he left a few dozen of his crew, killed two people, took more hostages and sailed back to Spain. As soon as they hit cooler weather, the Ta\\xc3\\xadno began to die, according to Howard Zinn in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s History of the United States.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter significantly overselling the prospects for gold to the king and queen of Spain, Columbus returned to Hispaniola with 17 ships and 1,200 men. The men he had left at the fort the year before had all been killed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cafter they had roamed the island in gangs looking for gold, taking women and children as slaves for sex and labor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Zinn wrote.\\r\\n\\r\\nColumbus and his crew searched and searched for gold to no avail, so they filled their ships with something else they could sell: people. Of the 500 Ta\\xc3\\xadno they took \\xe2\\x80\\x94 selected because they were the strongest and healthiest specimens \\xe2\\x80\\x94 200 died on the voyage to Spain. Many more died once they had been sold into slavery.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Columbus tried again for gold, but this time he and his men didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go looking for it. They ordered all Ta\\xc3\\xadno people 14 and older to deliver a certain amount of gold dust every three months. If they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, their hands would be cut off.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point, the Ta\\xc3\\xadno were refusing to grow crops, and those who didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bleed to death after their hands were removed began to die of famine and disease. When they fled into the mountains, they were hunted down by dogs. Many killed themselves with cassava poison.\\r\\n\\r\\nColumbus\\xe2\\x80\\x99s men also continued to sexually abuse Ta\\xc3\\xadno women and girls. In 1500, Columbus wrote to an acquaintance that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere are many dealers who go about looking for girls; those from nine to 10 are now in demand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the population plummeted, they abducted indigenous people from other islands, like the Lucayan, to work the fields and mines of Hispaniola. When the British colonized the Bahamas in the 1600s, the islands had been deserted for more than a century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis engraving by Joos van Winghe and Theodor de Bry depicts the atrocities committed by Spanish explorers on the indigenous people of the Caribbean described by Bartolom\\xc3\\xa9 de las Casas. (Peace Palace Library/Peace Palace Library, The Netherlands)\\r\\n\\r\\nBartolom\\xc3\\xa9 de las Casas arrived in Hispaniola in 1502, when he was 18. For decades, he participated in the mistreatment of the Ta\\xc3\\xadno and the introduction of enslaved Africans, before renouncing it all, becoming a Dominican friar and confessing what he had witnessed in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is worth quoting him at length. This excerpt is very graphic:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey [Spanish explorers] forced their way into native settlements, slaughtering everyone they found there, including small children, old men, pregnant women, and even women who had just given birth. They hacked them to pieces, slicing open their bellies with their swords as though they were so many sheep herded into a pen. They even laid wagers on whether they could slice a man in two at a stroke, or cut an individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head from his body, or disembowel him with a single blow of their axes. They grabbed suckling infants by the feet and, ripping them from their mothers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 breasts, dashed them headlong against the rocks. Others, laughing and joking all the while, threw them over their shoulders, shouting, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Wriggle, you little perisher.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen las Casas wrote this in 1542, there were only 200 Ta\\xc3\\xadno left on Hispaniola. Across the Caribbean, he claimed the Spanish were responsible for the deaths of 12 to 15 million indigenous people.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorians usually attribute most of the deaths to the spread of diseases for which native people had no immunity, but recently historian Andr\\xc3\\xa9s Res\\xc3\\xa9ndez has pushed back against this, arguing that populations were lower than previous estimated, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca nexus of slavery, overwork and famine killed more Indians in the Caribbean than smallpox, influenza and malaria.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after Columbus\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death in 1506, Spanish explorers moved on to other islands, like Puerto Rico and Jamaica, and according to las Casas, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperpetrated the same outrages and committed the same crimes as before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1650, Zinn wrote, reports indicated the Ta\\xc3\\xadno were extinct.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut recent scholarship proves that may not have been the case. Researchers compared the DNA from the tooth of a pre-Columbian Lucayan woman found in a cave in the Bahamas to that of contemporary Puerto Ricans, who are generally thought to be an interracial mix of African, European and Native American ancestry. They found that the Native American component in the Puerto Rican samples was closely related to the Lucayan DNA. The results were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nJorge Estevez, a Ta\\xc3\\xadno descendant who assisted the research, told Newsweek: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish my grandmother were alive today so that I could confirm to her what she already knew. It shows that the true story is one of assimilation, certainly, but not total extinction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ta\\xc3\\xadno also live on in our language \\xe2\\x80\\x94 barbecue, hammock, canoe, tobacco and hurricane are all derived from Ta\\xc3\\xadno words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA pre-Columbian drawing by the Ta\\xc3\\xadno in a cave in San Cristobal, Dominican Republic.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been siphoning support from Sanders among the party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most liberal voters, a group that belonged solely to Sanders in 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemocrats at Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign events often express approval of both his policies and Warren\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, citing their similar anti-establishment views. But Warren\\xe2\\x80\\x99s support has been climbing while Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99s has been fading, and polls suggest that while the senator from Vermont is cementing support from his core followers with his purist plans, Warren may be benefiting from the perception that she is not the most radical figure in the Democratic field.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nEven President Trump weighed in on Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99s predicament Friday at a rally in Louisiana, wishing him a speedy recovery while opining that if Sanders does not win the Democratic nomination most of his supporters will probably go to Warren.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the two senators jockey for position in the Democratic field, they have been reluctant to attack each other directly for fear of alienating each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supporters, and they often call each other friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in an interview Sunday at his home in Burlington, Vt., Sanders was pressed by ABC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Jon Karl to draw a line between him and Warren, and he did so, albeit with apparent reluctance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cElizabeth has said she is a capitalist through to her bones. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sanders said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am, I believe, the only candidate who is going to say to the ruling class of this country, the corporate elite, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Enough. Enough with your greed and your corruption.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nMonday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan is the second proposal Sanders has issued since being sidelined from the trail that seeks to cut corporate influence. The first plan targeted corporate money in politics, while the latest proposal takes a more comprehensive swing at the way corporations treat workers, pay taxes, and interact with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe centerpiece of the plan aims to dramatically shift control over U.S. corporations from Wall Street shareholders to tens of millions of workers who currently have little say in the management of the companies where they work.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanders proposes forcing all publicly traded companies, as well as all private companies with more than $100 million in revenue, to give their workers at least 45 percent of the seats on their corporate boards \\xe2\\x80\\x94 going further than a similar idea from Warren, who has called for giving workers 40 percent of those seats.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond that, Sanders would require the companies to issue a portion of their stock holdings to a fund controlled by workers. These worker-controlled shares \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Sanders calls them \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDemocratic Employee Ownership Funds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 would give employees a percentage of the dividends paid out by the corporation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanders takes a step beyond Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Labour Party, by calling for corporations to turn over at least 20 percent of their shares to these worker funds, compared to 10 percent for Corbyn. The workers would then elect a board to manage and disburse the shares.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plan would amount to a sweeping transformation of the American economy and empower workers in a far-reaching new way. But critics say it would also give businesses an incentive to hire contractors instead of full-time employees, potentially hurting workers rather than helping them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, about 7,000 companies in the United States are set up to allow employees to own a substantial share of their businesses, representing about 11 million workers, according to Joseph R. Blasi and Douglas L. Kruse of Rutgers University.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan would aim to give an additional 56 million workers, in more than 22,000 companies, a share of their businesses. The campaign says workers at McDonald\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, for example, would ultimately control 20 percent of its stock and 45 percent of the vote on its management decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat we want is democracy within the workplace, so the decisions aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t all being made by a tiny number of people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter Gowan, a senior policy associate at the Democracy Collaborative, a left-leaning think tank, who worked with the Sanders campaign on the proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nSanders also proposes some smaller measures designed to increase worker control of the economy, such as a $500 million bank for employees who want to buy or start their own firms and the creation of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cworker ownership centers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to help employees manage their own companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanders also offered a sweeping set of antitrust policies, including a new \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbright line\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that would bar mergers of companies with too much market share. Warren has released antitrust plans related to agriculture and big tech, according to Matt Stoller, fellow at the Open Markets Institute, but not a comprehensive antitrust plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanders also proposes some smaller measures designed to increase worker control of the economy, such as a $500 million bank for employees who want to buy or start their own firms and the creation of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cworker ownership centers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to help employees manage their own companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nSanders also offered a sweeping set of antitrust policies, including a new \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbright line\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that would bar mergers of companies that dominate too much market share. Warren has released antitrust plans related to agriculture and big tech, according to Matt Stoller, fellow at the Open Markets Institute, but not a comprehensive antitrust plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plan reflects in part the battle to construct the left\\xe2\\x80\\x99s agenda, as Sanders and Warren vie for liberal voters. Both candidates have come under fire from the business community for their ideas, including the criticism that they would discourage entrepreneurs from starting businesses and would prompt investors to put their money overseas.\\r\\n\\r\\nJim Kessler, senior vice president of policy at the centrist think tank Third Way, has said such plans may do little for custodial or food service workers, who are often on contract. A Sanders campaign aide has said the senator has introduced legislation to prevent misclassification of workers as contractors.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nPlans to boost employee-owned businesses have earned some interest from lawmakers in both parties, albeit with narrower measures. Republican Sens. Pat Roberts (Kan.) and Thom Tillis (N.C.), for instance, have pushed legislation to encourage technical assistance and other help for such firms.\\r\\n\\r\\nSanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan would also repeal the 2017 GOP tax cut for corporations, which lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Many congressional Democrats also favor raising the corporate tax rate, though few want to raise it as much as Sanders.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder his plan, America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s corporate tax rate would be among the highest in the world. Corporate tax rates have fallen globally, including in the European countries often cited as a model by Sanders, with Sweden and Norway both taxing firms below 25 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recent populist surge has prompted some in both parties to look for ways to cut the power of government and corporations. Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supporters say his approach would provide much-needed influence to ordinary Americans, but conservatives argue that raising corporate taxes would ultimately hurt those same people.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCorporations might write the tax check to the government, but the tax is borne by consumers, workers and shareholders,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Nicole Kaeding, vice president of policy promotion at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. Raising the rate to 35 percent, she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwould result in a smaller U.S. economy and lower wages.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d'\n",

      "b'\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Trump spoke at the Values Voter Summit in Washington on Oct. 12. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe timeline isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t complicated. Responding to news reports about President Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interactions with Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s president, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced that her party was initiating an impeachment inquiry in the House. The following day, Sept. 25, the White House released a rough transcript of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, which demonstrated that Trump had, in fact, asked Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden. The next day, the White House released the complaint written by an intelligence community whistleblower that contextualized Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s requests in the broader context of how the president and his attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani were trying to get Ukraine to act against Biden.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proved to be difficult for Trump to argue that his actions were appropriate. Instead, he and his allies have tried to argue around the edges, criticizing how the whistleblower filed his complaint or how the Democrats are conducting the impeachment probe instead of defending Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions on the merits.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent days, Trump has gone further, misrepresenting how Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) came to criticize Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s call with Zelensky. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a remarkable glimpse at how Trump tries to shift reality in front of our eyes, but also a good example of how hard it can be to suss out the line between a mistake and a lie.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sept. 26, the day after the rough transcript was released, Schiff offered a paraphrase of its contents during a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee, of which he serves as chair. The paraphrasing cast Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s call in a deliberately negative light, with CNN\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fact-checker Daniel Dale writing that Schiff \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdid make it easy for viewers to get confused\\xe2\\x80\\x9d about what Trump had actually said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short order, Trump seized on Schiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s depiction of the call as problematic to the point of criminality. This is standard operating procedure for a guy who spent decades in New York real estate, inflating everything to its extreme. But over time, as Dale noted on Sunday, it also led Trump to reorder history to try to make Schiff look even more dishonest than Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s misrepresentations.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe got there in three steps.\\r\\n\\r\\nStep 1: Trump says Schiff lied about the call and got caught.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRep. Adam B. Schiff fraudulently read to Congress, with millions of people watching, a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump tweeted on the day after Schiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s committee hearing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call, but he completely changed the words to make it sound horrible, and me sound guilty. HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgot caught\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the sense that, during the hearing, Schiff was called out by Republicans for the paraphrasing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sept. 29, Trump escalated his rhetoric.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSchiff made up what I actually said by lying to Congress,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he wrote on Twitter. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber. He wrote down and read terrible things, then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States. I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNotice, though, that Trump is still presenting the timeline correctly at this point. At a swearing-in ceremony for Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia, Trump presented Schiff\\'s actions in the proper order.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen he saw my call to the President of Ukraine, it was so good that he couldn\\'t quote from it because it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 there was nothing done wrong,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was perfect. So Adam B. Schiff decided, \\'I can\\'t let this happen, so let me make up.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe repeated a similar complaint the following day.\\r\\n\\r\\nMind you, Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s complaints are not without some irony. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAdam B. Schiff \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 made up my words, which I think is just a horrible,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said during that same event. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never even seen a thing like that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Trump claims Schiff and Pelosi were somehow caught by the transcript of the call.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a tweet on Oct. 5, Trump for the first time blurs the timeline of events.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe so-called Whistleblower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account of my perfect phone call is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cway off,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d not even close. Schiff and Pelosi never thought I would release the transcript of the call. Got them by surprise, they got caught. This is a fraud against the American people! \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2019\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump has argued that Pelosi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s call for impeachment was hobbled by his release of the transcript, which is not a view shared by Pelosi or many other observers. Trump is likely tying Schiff and Pelosi together here solely to taint Schiff through association with the unpopular-with-Republicans Pelosi. But we see the rough outline of a more nefarious and more explicitly false accusation: that Schiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s paraphrasing was uncovered by the release of the transcript.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following day, Trump tweeted that both Pelosi and Schiff were guilty of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHigh Crimes and Misdemeanors, and even Treason\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that they should \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbe immediately Impeached!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d These are ridiculous assertions for a number of reasons, but it shows both the fervor of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s efforts to strike back at his opponents and his disinterest in accuracy while doing so.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. He claims that Schiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s misrepresentation of the call was exposed when Trump released the transcript.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Oct. 7, Trump for the first time inverted the order of what happened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had a perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine \\xe2\\x80\\x94 like, I mean perfect,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople read it, but they don\\'t read that. They heard Schiff\\'s version of it. He defrauded the American public. He gave the most horrible rendition, adding his own words.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He took a quick aside to note that no one had ever seen anything like it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe made it up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump continued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause what happened is they spoke about a day too early.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey\\xe2\\x80\\x9d here still seems like Trump may be lumping Schiff together with Pelosi, but the implication is clear: Schiff made up what Trump\\'s call said \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but he spoke too early in doing so.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking to reporters before leaving the White House for a political rally in Minnesota on Oct. 10, Trump made his first explicit assertion that Schiff had presented his paraphrasing before the transcript was released.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will say this: Adam B. Schiff took that conversation before he saw it and fabricated a conversation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo me, that\\'s criminal. What he did is criminal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the rally, Trump was back to the proper order \\xe2\\x80\\x94 before again blurring what happened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo we released the transcript of the call, which was so good that that crooked Adam B. Schiff, this guy is crooked. He had to make up a fake conversation that never happened and he delivered to the United States Congress and the American people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said. He went on to criticize Pelosi for defending Schiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comments in an interview with ABC News.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese people are sick,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said of Pelosi and Schiff. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sick, and you know what? Had they waited one day longer, they would have had the transcript of the actual call, word for word, and it would have been perfect. Instead, they released it, they went early. They said all these horrible things. Do you know why? Because they never thought in a million years that I was going to release a transcript of the call.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking to reporters the following day, he was back to the correct order of events.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSchiff made up a story,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause when Schiff read what I actually said, he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say this because he did nothing wrong.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 So Schiff went out, and he made up a lie.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at the Value Voters Summit on Saturday, Trump again suggested that Schiff was busted by the transcript.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe made up a phone call, but then I did something that they didn\\'t expect,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said of Schiff. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI immediately called up Ukraine, through my representatives \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I got approval to immediately make that call public.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s not true, but on Monday morning he reiterated that order.\\r\\n\\r\\n....Democrat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s game was foiled when we caught Schiff fraudulently making up my Ukraine conversation, when I released the exact conversation Transcript, and when Ukrainian President and the Foreign Minister said there was NO PRESSURE, very normal talk! A total Impeachment Scam! \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe implication \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if not the specific wording \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is that the transcript caught Schiff, which it didn\\'t.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s an objective reality here. Schiff\\'s representation of what Trump said on the call came only after the transcript was already out. Trump is clearly hoping to convince listeners that the timeline was reversed, changing Schiff\\'s paraphrasing from something misleading into something nefarious and changing Trump\\'s response from one of frustration to one of cleverness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s fair to wonder, though, the extent to which the timeline has actually become muddied. At times Trump conveys events properly, albeit with a hyperbolic response. At times he conflates Schiff and Pelosi. At times he presents Schiff as having been caught red-handed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich one Trump actually believes isn\\'t clear. It probably doesn\\'t matter. His strategy is often simply to generate enough reasonable doubt about a subject that his supporters and Americans more broadly simply throw up their hands in exasperation about knowing what actually happened. Here, though, it\\'s not complicated.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump said something else revealing at the Value Voters Summit on Saturday.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\'re of the opinion,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said of Schiff and Pelosi \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjust keep saying it, saying it, saying it, maybe someday they\\'ll believe it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd frankly if I weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t there, because I was incredulous. I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump continued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI heard it, I said, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not what I said. He made up a conversation, and it was vicious what he said. And then we caught him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he just keeps saying it, saying it, saying it, maybe someday the public will believe it.'\n",

(Eric Risberg/AP)\\r\\n\\r\\nLawmakers seeking to overhaul Silicon Valley\\'s prized legal shield are getting more ammunition.\\r\\n\\r\\nFair-housing advocates are accusing Airbnb and other short-term rental platforms of abusing the legal provision that grants tech companies broad immunity for content people post on its platforms. They want Congress to ensure online rental services cannot ignore \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and profit off\\xe2\\x80\\x94 listings that violate state and local housing laws.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese companies are knowingly facilitating and profiting from illegal listings all-the-while driving up the cost and access to housing and they must be held accountable,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the groups wrote to members of Congress last week.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the debate over Congress reviewing of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act has focused on social media companies: Republicans argue they\\'re using the law to unfairly silence conservative voices and Democrats say the act should be changed to ensure social media giants take greater responsibility for disinformation and other problematic content.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this latest attack, coming just days before a House Energy and Commerce joint subcommittee hearing to examine the decades-old law, shows that changes could have consequences for other tech platforms such as online marketplaces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe groups, led by the progressive group American Family Voices, are urging Congress to pass the Protecting Local Authority and Neighborhoods Act, which would clarify the law\\xe2\\x80\\x99s application in this case \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and make Airbnb responsible for illegal listings posted on its site.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Airbnb model essentially says, we don\\'t care whether your vacation rental is illegal, we don\\'t care whether your vacation rental is disrupting neighborhoods, we don\\'t care if your vacation rental is jacking up housing prices and removing inventory from the local community,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Rep. Ed Case (D-Hawaii), a former hotel executive who introduced the PLAN Act, which is being considered by the full committee. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat model has had serious negative effects on communities across the country.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Airbnb says the bill is nothing more than a ploy by the hotel lobby to stifle competition and that it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cknowingly ignores\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the company\\'s record of reaching compromises with cities to enforce short-term rental rules and collect taxes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe protections and authority provided by [Section 230] make it possible for 7 million listings to operate on the Airbnb marketplace, fueling innovation and competition that benefits consumers to the tune of 2 million stays a night globally,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Airbnb spokeswoman Molly Weedn wrote in a statement, adding that the company partners with more than 500 local governments and organizations around the world. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFurthermore, CDA 230 ensures Airbnb is able to screen content and block objectionable material.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGoogle and Reddit \\xe2\\x80\\x94 whose representatives will testify at Wednesday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hearing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and other companies have also long pointed to Section 230 as essential to their ability to moderate content.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the situation is even more complicated for online marketplaces such as Airbnb and even eBay, which argue that the immunity exempts them from being held liable for transactions by their users that violate state and local laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nAirbnb has put this defense to the test, with mixed results. The company sued both Santa Monica, Calif., and Boston over regulations that compelled the company to enforce and monitor illegal listings.\\r\\n\\r\\nAirbnb settled with Boston last month in a compromise that required residents seeking to rent their properties to prove they had permission to do so from the city, and for the company to develop stronger channels for the city to notify Airbnb of illegal listings. It reached a similar compromise with the city of Portland, Ore., in September.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in Santa Monica a federal judge sided with the city, ruling in March that while the content of Airbnb listings are protected by Section 230, any illegal activity facilitated \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in this case, a violation of a short-term rentals law \\xe2\\x80\\x94 was not. Last week the same court upheld the ruling in another challenge against the Santa Monica ordinance brought by an Airbnb host.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome lawyers say this shows the PLAN Act is unnecessary. Cities and states have demonstrated that they can rein in short-term rentals and come up with compromises through existing legal channels, argues Santa Clara University law professor Eric Goldman.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd putting in place specific carve-outs to Section 230 would make it more difficult for tech companies, including Airbnb, to take down harmful or illegal content at will, he says.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEach hole in Section 230 creates its own challenge to the integrity of Section 230,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Goldman says.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut not all legal experts agree that allowing the conflicts between cities and Airbnb to play out in court is the solution.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbbey Stemler, an assistant professor of business law and ethics at Indiana University who wrote an amicus brief for Santa Monica in the 9th Circuit case, said Airbnb\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of Section 230 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstretched beyond recognition\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the original intent of the law.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Stemler expressed concerns about the PLAN Act specifically as the solution, she said that Congress could do more to clarify the intent of the law.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI definitely think that the court system is too slow. Lawmakers have a better chance of deterring the harmful market failures associated with these platforms,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stemler says. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf the platform is making money off something illegal, then it should be pretty simple to hold the platforms accountable for it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are reading The Technology 202, our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.

      "b'THE LIGHTBULB\\r\\n\\r\\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File )\\r\\n\\r\\nWill Rick Perry comply with Congress? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the question hanging over the energy secretary now that he has been served a subpoena in the House impeachment inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree top House Democrats on Thursday officially requested Perry to turn over a trove of documents related to the Trump administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interactions with Ukraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Perry, who has built a reputation in Washington as one of the rare Trump Cabinet officials with whom congressional Democrats can amicably work, will have to decide whether to listen to Congress at perhaps the most trying juncture of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidency.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerry\\'s decision will be an early test of how tightly President Trump is able to control his deputies from becoming witnesses in Congress\\'s impeachment inquiry as the White House more broadly seeks to limit the information lawmakers have in their investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier this month, Perry suggested he would go along with orders from Congress. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\'re going to work with Congress and answer all their questions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Perry told reporters in Chicago on Oct. 2. An Energy Department spokesperson did not reply to requests for comment on Friday or over the weekend.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that was before Perry was directly subpoenaed, rather than just being mentioned in subpoenas issued to the White House and to Trump\\'s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it was before the White House issued a scorched-earth letter declaring it would refuse to cooperate with the impeachment investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerry, though accused of no wrongdoing, finds himself closer to the center of a Trump scandal than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring a July 25 phone call, Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open an investigation into one of his political rivals, former vice president Joe Biden. Trump later said Perry asked him to make that call, but Perry told reporters last week he did it so that the two could talk about energy issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four-page subpoena directs Perry to hand over documents related to his involvement in the July call as well as to a Ukrainian state-owned natural gas company. The House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees have set a deadline of Oct. 18 for Perry to comply.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subpoena from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Thursday. (AP Photo/Jon Elswick)\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is precedent for Perry to follow if he wants follow the subpoena. The White House hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been able to stop some administration officials from succumbing to the pressure of legal orders from Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite a directive not to participate, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch went to Capitol Hill under subpoena on Friday. And Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, plans to testify this week under subpoena despite the State Department blocking him from previously appearing at a voluntary deposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy testifying or providing documents, administration officials risk having Trump fire them. But as The Post\\'s Matt Zapotosky explains, the consequences of defying a congressional subpoena \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which include fines or prison \\xe2\\x80\\x94 could be seen as worse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Energy Department, which runs national laboratories and maintains the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nuclear stockpile, has kept a relatively low profile during the Trump administration.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerry has been on the receiving end of a lot less criticism from Democrats compared to other Trump officials working on energy and environmental issues, such as former Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt and ex-Interior Department secretary Ryan Zinke.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just because he\\'s managed to avoid major ethics controversies in office. It\\'s in part because the Energy Department has relatively fewer regulations to potentially roll back. (Though last week, a group of Senate Democrats wrote to the energy secretary urging the administration\\'s reversal of energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs.) And it\\'s partly because of the congeniality Perry brings to his interactions with Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nOften Perry has assuaged fears from congressional Democrats worried about funding cut requests to the Energy Department coming from budgetary ax officials in the White House, such as current acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring a hearing last year, for example, Perry heaped praise onto an energy technology incubator, popular on both sides of the aisle, for \\xe2\\x80\\x9chaving such a profound impact on American lives\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 despite the White House officially requesting to slash its budget to zero.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerry has had an easy rapport with congressional Democrats privately \\xe2\\x80\\x94 sometimes bringing them in on conference calls \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as well as on the dais.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen former senator and Saturday Night Live comedian Al Franken asked Perry during his confirmation hearing whether he enjoyed meeting him in his office, Perry quipped: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope you are as much fun on that dais as you were on your couch.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are reading The Energy 202, our must-read tipsheet on energy and the environment.

At the United Nations, he made strong comments in defense of the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s promised autonomy, saying the world \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfully expects\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Beijing will protect \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHong Kong\\xe2\\x80\\x99s freedom, legal system and democratic ways of life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking to reporters last week after a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, however, Trump said the situation in Hong Kong is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoing to take care of itself\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and has \\xe2\\x80\\x9cde-escalated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n\\r\\nHawley, the congressman, said the situation in Hong Kong is an \\xe2\\x80\\x9curgent, pressing concern\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and would share his experiences with Trump.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sunday, protests broke out in several areas of the city, a new tactic that sought to scatter the police force, allow demonstrators to stick to local neighborhoods they are most familiar with and avoid transit shutdowns. Numbers however were much smaller than in past rallies, and police were able to make a large number of arrests compared to the size of the demonstrating crowd.\\r\\n\\r\\n[From Shake Shack to Starbucks, the Hong Kong-China standoff is proving bad for business]\\r\\n\\r\\nProtester violence has also increased, leaving 12 officers wounded, including one who was cut in the back of his neck by a sharp object.

      "b\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (right) meet at the Saudi Royal palace in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Monday. (Alexey Nikolsky/Sputnik/Kremlin/Pool/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\\r\\n\\r\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin landed in Riyadh on Monday for his first state visit to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in more than a decade, emphasizing not only coordination between three of the biggest oil producers in the world but also Moscow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growing influence in the Middle East.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe timing may be especially fortuitous for Putin. President Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s announcement last week that the United States would be pulling out of northeast Syria, as well as his equivocation over the conflict with Iran, has left many traditional U.S. allies in the region nervous.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome such as the Syrian Kurds already argue that they have been abandoned, but the wider implications are still being felt in Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and even Jerusalem. Notably, Russia maintains relations in all those cities, even as it works with rivals in Tehran, Damascus and Ankara, and faces U.S. sanctions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe build bilateral relations that rely on positive trends generated by our contacts; we do not build alliances against anyone,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Putin said in a joint interview with Saudi-owned Al Arabiya, Sky News Arabia and RT Arabic that aired Sunday.\\r\\n\\r\\nPutin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trip to Saudi Arabia and the UAE marks his first state visits to the countries since 2007. It shows continuing warming ties between Russia and the two Gulf States, which were traditionally Western allies with little ties to Moscow during the Cold War and who, until recently, maintained relatively modest trade links.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is part of a strategy that puts Moscow at the center of Middle East politics. Putin recently announced that he intends to visit another U.S. ally, Israel, early next year. Embattled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Russia to meet with Putin last month, just days before a bitterly contested election.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE, as well as Israel, had viewed the Trump presidency as a chance to reinvigorate their relationship with the United States. But while they appeared to favor Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to pull the United States out of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran and other world powers, as tensions across the Persian Gulf grew, there were increasing doubts.\\r\\n\\r\\nA crippling attack on key Saudi oil facilities last month raised new questions about Saudi Arabia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to protect itself, even with its expensive relationship with the United States and the masses of U.S.-made weapons it buys. The United States announced Friday that it would be sending 1,800 troops to Saudi Arabia, but the president emphasized the financial aspect of the deal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSaudi Arabia, at my request, has agreed to pay us for everything we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump told reporters. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a first.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe announcement that troops would be sent to Saudi Arabia came as U.S. forces were abruptly pulled out of northeastern Syria, allowing a Turkish offensive that threatened to devastate Syrian Kurds, who had been instrumental in the fight against the Islamic State.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. pullout resulted in a last-minute agreement between forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Kurdish forces, once on opposing sides of Syria\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long-running civil war. Since an intervention in 2015, Russia has been allied with Assad, providing air power and other support in an often brutal conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nRussia had played a key role in three days of negotiations that led to the agreement between the Syrian government and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a primarily Kurdish military alliance in Syria\\xe2\\x80\\x99s northeast, a Kurdish intelligence official told The Washington Post.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoscow has good relations not only with the Kurds and Syria, but also with Turkey. Though Turkey is a member of NATO and an ally of the United States, Russia began deliveries of its S-400 missile defense system to Turkey in the summer, hastening a spat between Ankara and Washington, which suspended Turkish involvement in the U.S. F-35 fighter jet program in response.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe S-400 system is considered one of the most advanced missile defense systems in the world, but most U.S. allies have avoided purchasing it for fear of angering Washington. Last month, after the attack on Saudi Arabia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oil facilities, Putin jokingly suggested at an event in Ankara with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that the kingdom should have purchased the weapons.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe political leadership of Saudi Arabia just needs to make a wise state decision,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Putin said, pointing to the purchase of the S-300 missile system by Iran and the S-400 missile system by Turkey. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, also in attendance at the event, was shown smiling after the remark.\\r\\n\\r\\nRussia ultimately remains far weaker than the United States in a variety of ways. Its economy has suffered greatly under sanctions, and it has suffered a number of humiliating military setbacks in recent years; even its vaunted S-400 system remains untested in real life.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut with longtime partners Syria\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Kurds finding themselves at odds with Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Middle East plans, and even those with many friends in Washington such as Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Netanyahu unsure of their footing, allies such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE may see Russia as a more reliable alternative \\xe2\\x80\\x94 even if it is opposed to the United States and allied with many of their own rivals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his interview with Arab media outlets on Sunday, Putin emphasized the positives of his relationships with Saudi Arabia and the UAE but made no secret of his government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ties to Iran and Syria. He said that while his government did not need to mediate, it could play a role.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat you can do is maintain a friendly conversation with them and present some ideas from a friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perspective,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Putin said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am convinced that as highly intelligent people, they listen and analyze everything they hear.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\"\n",

      "b'\\r\\n\\r\\nAn undated file photo of South Korean singer and actress Sulli, who was found dead at her home on Monday. (Yonhap/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\\r\\n\\r\\nLeading South Korean K-pop singer and actress Sulli was found dead in her house south of the capital on Monday in what police said may have been suicide.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 25-year-old started her career as a child actress in 2005 and later joined a girl group as a teenager, before announcing she was quitting the entertainment industry in 2014. She said then that she was mentally and physically exhausted after suffering from malicious comments and false rumors online. She formally left her band the following year to resume an acting career.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast year, she took the rare step of speaking out about her mental health issues, saying she had suffered from panic disorder since she was young and also had social phobia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf she is found to have taken her own life, it would highlight the huge pressures on K-pop stars exerted by exploitative management companies and demanding fans and the lack of mental health support.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe star, whose legal name is Choi Jin-ri, was found dead by her agent on Monday afternoon in a two-story house in Seongnam.\\r\\n\\r\\nA note believed to have been written by Choi has been found at the house, which described her state of mind but was not a suicide note, according to the police.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cChoi seemed to have lived alone in the house, and no signs of a struggle or forced entry has been identified to suggest homicide,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Kim Seong-taek of Seongnam Sujeong Police Department. But Kim said police had not concluded it was definitely a suicide and continued to investigate the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nSulli challenged the notions on how a female Kpop star should behave, but she suffered massively as a result.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was viciously attacked online in 2014 after paparazzi photos revealed she was dating an older rapper. In a rare move, she later publicly acknowledged the couple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s relationship. K-pop stars usually face pressure not to date because it can disillusion their fans and undermine their career.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe would also often appear without a bra, saying she felt more comfortable without one, something that some Korean women found liberating but others savagely criticized.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June, she became a co-host of a TV show entitled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Night of Hate Comments,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in which celebrity guests discussed their reactions to hateful comments, malicious rumors and cyberbullying.\\r\\n\\r\\nYonhap news agency said Choi had suffered criticism and drawn support for what it called her \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbold and carefree character.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven close people left me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Choi said in an Instagram video posted last year. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was hurt by them and felt there was nobody who understands me, which made me fall apart.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more\\r\\n\\r\\nSex scandals stain the clean-cut image of South Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s K-pop\\r\\n\\r\\nHow K-pop is luring young North Koreans to cross the line\\r\\n\\r\\nToday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news'\n",

      "b'In response to Monday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling, separatist sympathizers in Catalonia vowed massive civil disobedience in a rejection of a process they deemed overly harsh. Police forces descended on Barcelona, the Catalan capital, as demonstrators marched on major transit hubs, including the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s international airport.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nCatalan officials attacked what they considered excessively harsh sentences and called on the Spanish government to negotiate a different solution. But Madrid refused to back down and urged respect for the rule of law.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe tended to think that this was something impossible in 20th-century Europe; now we see that it is possible,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Alfred Bosch, Catalonia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minister for foreign action, institutional relations and transparency, told The Washington Post. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPolitical leaders were condemned to 100 years in jail because they held a vote,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said referring to the cumulative length of all the sentences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRight now, in the heart of Europe, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really worrisome and troubling.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Pedro S\\xc3\\xa1nchez, Spain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s acting prime minister, defended the ruling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn a social and democratic state of law, compliance means full compliance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told reporters. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis has been a judicial process with full guarantees and transparency.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe government of Spain will work in the coming days toward guaranteeing public order and protecting our democratic laws as it has always done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least one Catalan civic group said it would respect the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling. In a statement, the Catalan Civil Society urged local authorities \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot to call for confrontation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But others, such as FC Barcelona, one of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most popular soccer teams, objected to the prison sentences. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPrison is not the solution,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the group said in a statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree other defendants were found guilty merely of disobedience, which means they will be fined but not serve prison time. All 12 defendants were acquitted of the more serious charge of rebellion, but top Catalan officials were given the lengthier sentences.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nSpanish prosecutors initially sought a prison term of 25 years for Oriol Junqueras, Catalonia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s former vice president and the highest-ranking Catalan official on trial. Junqueras was ultimately sentenced to 13 years, the longest the court handed down.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the ruling, Junqueras said Monday that Catalan independence was \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccloser than ever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d His comments were relayed by his Republic Left party.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA total of 100 years of prison. How horrible. Now more than ever, we will be with you and your families. For the future of our sons and daughters. For democracy. For Europe. For Catalonia,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Carles Puigdemont, a former regional president of Catalonia, said in a statement on Twitter. Puigdemont fled Spain to Belgium after calling the 2017 referendum.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpain on Monday renewed its extradition request for Puigdemont.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ruling looks set to play a role in Spanish elections in early November, the fourth vote the country has held in four years. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\\xc3\\xa1nchez, a Socialist, was unable to form a government after winning a general election in April, largely because of a standoff with smaller parties on the far left and political center.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical analysts viewed the vote in the context of Spain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mounting political fragmentation.

At the time, Elias, 18, was stationed in Hawaii and Japan on the USS Rankin, and Ilaine, 19, was back in their hometown of Blackwood, N.J., about 15 miles from Philadelphia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe notes were just so beautifully written,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Wolke, 24, who also lives in Clarksville. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReading them just made your heart melt.

How are you? I received two letters today from you hon and you can just imagine how good I feel.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She signed off with lines of X\\xe2\\x80\\x99s for kisses and wrote: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll of these and millions more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another letter, Elias wrote to Ilaine: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe time now is 18:50 p.m. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been exactly 30 minutes writing this letter so far,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and he asks her if she likes the pillowcase he sent her from Geneva.

Please think of me while I am away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ending to the love story, however, was missing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nWolke and Grant became so invested in the lives of Ilaine and Elias that they wanted to know what happened. Did they get married and live happily together? Was Elias killed at war? Did one of them fall in love with someone else? Grant and Wolke couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it out of their minds.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they turned to an ancestry website to try to find the couple.\\r\\n\\r\\nWolke and Grant were delighted to learn that, after the war, the young lovebirds had indeed married and had four children.

Of course I had to look,... Posted by Lindsy Louise Wolke on Tuesday, September 3, 2019\\r\\n\\r\\nBarbara Murray, 65, of Clementon, N.J., one of the Maxwell children, had seen Wolke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s message about the letters but dismissed it as spam. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t until a friend sent Wolke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s post from the Facebook group that Murray allowed herself to consider it could be real.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sight of her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s handwriting on the envelopes left her \\xe2\\x80\\x9cliterally shaking,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter messaging back-and-forth, Wolke reached Murray on the phone \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a call that lasted nearly two hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was like an instant bond,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Murray said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t explain it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the war, her parents married in 1948 and started a family, she said. They worked at a stocking mill together. Then, Elias went on to work as a machinist for Pennwalt and Ilaine went to work in a sweater mill.\\r\\n\\r\\nElias died in 1993, and Ilaine moved to a nursing home in 2010, which is when their house in Clementon, N.J. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not far from their hometown of Blackwood \\xe2\\x80\\x94 went into liquidation, and the bank sold much of her parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 possessions, Murray said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMurray had one letter saved from her parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 wartime correspondence, but neither she nor her siblings knew there were more of their parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 historic love dispatches. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why they were in such shock that the letters turned up for sale years later, several states away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nMurray said she was extremely moved that the two young women found them and were so determined to track her down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere really are nice people still left in the world,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Murray said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the phone conversation, Wolke and Grant knew they needed to reunite the letters with the Maxwell family but couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t imagine anyone else making the delivery from Tennessee to New Jersey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe had such an attachment to these letters. We just loved them so much,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wolke said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t trust the mail service to take them up there and keep them safe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Oct. 4, a month after their incredible discovery, Wolke and Grant jumped in Grant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Toyota Camry and drove 800 miles, overnighting in Washington, to return all 21 letters to their rightful owners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four Maxwell siblings and their new friends from Tennessee met at a restaurant in New Jersey on Oct. 6. There was laughter and a few tears, before the siblings took Wolke and Grant on a tour of Elias and Ilaine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hometown. Wolke and Grant wanted to see all the places mentioned in the letters and to hear more about the couple they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d grown so fond of.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey visited the land that once belonged to Ilaine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family and the location of Elias\\xe2\\x80\\x99s childhood home. They found out that Ilaine and Elias met as kids and saw where the two would walk together to school.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThey heard stories about how Ilaine was shy and reserved, while Elias was outgoing. They were invited to take a look around the Maxwell family home. Several years after the bank took possession of it, Murray\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daughter purchased it back. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where the Maxwell children grew up \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the same home where Elias would put a board out on the back patio for tap dancing. (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe tap danced at all our weddings. He was a bit of a character,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Murray said.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStanding on that land and knowing Elias and Ilaine walked there, together, we felt a connection, like we were there with them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wolke said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd being in the house they built and raised a family in, it was just incredible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGrant added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe felt like we knew Ilaine and Elias, even before they had kids or got married. We just felt like we were meant to be there [in Blackwood].\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaving the letters in New Jersey was bittersweet for Wolke and Grant, but ultimately, the perfect ending to this story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was just so happy these letters were wanted,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wolke said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t discarded.

A devastated Katheryn Strang made \\xe2\\x80\\x9clost dog\\xe2\\x80\\x9d signs and took daily trips to the local shelter for months, desperate to find her.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Friday, Strang finally got the reunion she had been hoping for \\xe2\\x80\\x94 12 years after Dutchess disappeared.

      "b'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2002, Lee Boyd Malvo, 17, leaves the Fairfax County Juvenile and Domestic Relations courthouse after a hearing in juvenile court. Malvo was convicted of capital murder in the D.C. sniper shootings but is seeking to have his life sentences revisited because he was a juvenile. (Rich Lipski/The Washington Post)\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening in February 2002, a 21-year-old single mother named Keenya Cook was making dinner and taking care of her 6-month-old daughter when the doorbell rang at her Tacoma, Wash., home. When Cook answered, 16-year-old Lee Boyd Malvo shot her in the face, killing her. Shortly after his first murder, Malvo threw up.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had shot the wrong target. On orders from his mentor, John Allen Muhammad, Malvo was supposed to shoot Isa Farrington Nichols, Cook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aunt, who had supported Muhammad\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ex-wife in the custody battle over their children. The slaying orphaned Cook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daughter, devastated her family and ended Nichols\\xe2\\x80\\x99 marriage. But Nichols, and some other victims of the D.C. sniper rampage 17 years ago, are supporting Malvo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bid to be resentenced for his life without parole term, which will be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday as the latest chapter in the high court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s evolving reconsideration of how to handle juveniles in the criminal justice system.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is not about him being released,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nichols said, knowing that even reducing Malvo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 10 life sentences would not lead to his freedom. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe first time I heard it, I was like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Are you kidding me?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 This was someone sent to my door to kill me. But as I listened more and more, I understood the totality of what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s involved, and the other families involved in youths sentenced to life without parole \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I believe there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bigger picture here. This is something that needs to be done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all victims want to see Malvo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case reopened. Nelson Rivera, whose wife Lori Lewis Rivera, 25, was killed by the snipers in Kensington, Md., joined an amicus brief filed by the Maryland Crime Victims Resource Center that said the rulings clearing the way for Malvo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resentencing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cre-traumatize, revictimize, and violate the legal and human rights of victims.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The center\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawyer, Victor Stone, said that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpeople like Mr. Rivera lost a really important family member.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ordering new hearings \\xe2\\x80\\x9cputs a tremendous burden and revictimization on victims\\xe2\\x80\\x99 families who struggle with that loss. They spent years trying to resume a normal life. The lack of finality to them, that is really something,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d particularly if they must relive the trauma in new hearings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul LaRuffa, who was shot at close range by Lee Boyd Malvo in 2002, now supports Malvo\\'s bid for resentencing after the Supreme Court ruled that juvenile defendants should not receive mandatory life sentences. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post) (MARVIN JOSEPH/TWP/TWP)\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Cook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s slaying in Washington state, Malvo and Muhammad shot at least 21 more people around the country, killing 14 of them, including 10 homicides in the Washington area in a three-week rampage in October 2002. The shootings gripped the D.C. region and the world. The pair were arrested near Frederick, Md., and prosecuted in Virginia in 2003, where capital punishment was still an option for juveniles. Muhammad was sentenced to death, but Malvo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s jury chose a life sentence without parole rather than death for the Jamaican teen, who was 17 at the time of the sniper shootings. He then entered pleas in two additional Virginia shootings, and in six Maryland slayings, and received eight more life sentences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Supreme Court began a string of rulings that recognized the developing nature of teenage brains and changed the way juveniles are prosecuted. First in 2005, the court ruled that it was unconstitutional for juveniles to receive the death penalty, and in 2010 that juveniles may not receive life sentences for non-homicide convictions. Then in 2012, in Miller v. Alabama, the court ruled that juveniles may not be sentenced to life without parole unless they are found to be irreparably criminal. And in 2016, in Montgomery v. Louisiana, the court ruled that its Miller ruling could be applied to juvenile life sentences imposed years earlier.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe distinctive attributes of youth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Justice Elena Kagan wrote in Miller, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiminish the penological justifications for imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders, even when they commit terrible crimes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The ruling did not prohibit life sentences without parole, but required that judges or juries consider whether the crime \\xe2\\x80\\x9creflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or the defendant is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption\\xe2\\x80\\x9d deserving of the harshest penalty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so Malvo, through his original trial attorney Craig S. Cooley, sought a new sentencing in Virginia. Malvo at the time was one of about 2,800 people nationwide who were juveniles when they were sentenced to life without parole, according to the Campaign for Fair Sentencing of Youth. Once the Supreme Court declared that the Miller ruling was retroactive, resentencing hearings began across the country, with about 1,950 inmates getting new hearings or relief from new laws: 22 states and the District of Columbia have now prohibited life sentences without parole for juveniles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also a racial disparity to juvenile sentencings, said Jody Kent Lavy, executive director of the Campaign for Fair Sentencing of Youth. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfrican American youth get life sentences at a rate of 10 times white youth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lavy said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd racial disparity actually increases when judges get more discretion in sentencing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMalvo, now 34, is one of 12 people sentenced as juveniles and serving life in Virginia, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9che understands that even if his sentence is reduced \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not getting out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cooley said. Malvo has six convictions in Maryland, where a similar motion for resentencing is pending, and prosecutors in Arizona, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and Washington state could still charge him with murder. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt may benefit people who have only one charge and sentence to deal with,\" Cooley said of the Supreme Court case. \"It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an important case for precedential purposes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nCooley and Malvo first had their resentencing motion granted in 2017 by U.S. District Judge Raymond A. Jackson, who made it clear that Malvo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two convictions in Fairfax County, Va. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 capital murder of FBI analyst Linda Franklin as an act of terrorism, and multiple murders in a three-year period \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and two in Spotsylvania County, Va., were undisturbed and that new sentences could still result in life without parole. In Virginia, juries determine sentences in criminal cases, and judges then impose those sentences, with the option only to reduce them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMalvo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trial in 2003 was essentially one long sentencing hearing, in which his defense team laid out his troubled life story, and manipulation by Muhammad, as part of an insanity defense, which the jury rejected. But neither the jury nor Fairfax Circuit Court Judge Jane Marum Roush considered the criteria established nine years later by the Supreme Court of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cirreparable corruption\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctransient immaturity of youth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and Jackson ruled that Malvo was entitled to have his crimes reviewed through that lens.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s husband, William \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Franklin, said he was unfamiliar with developments in the case and declined to comment.\\r\\n\\r\\nVirginia Attorney General Mark Herring (D) appealed Jackson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling, and last year the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit reluctantly sided with Malvo. Judges Paul V. Niemeyer, Robert B. King and Albert Diaz wrote that their conclusions were made \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot with any satisfaction but to sustain the law.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHerring appealed again, and the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attorney general argues that the lower courts improperly expanded the Supreme Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rulings to cases where the court had discretion in sentencing, as opposed to a mandatory life sentence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, Fairfax County Chief Deputy Commonwealth\\'s Attorney Raymond F. Morrogh, left, and Commonwealth\\'s Attorney Robert F. Horan enter the courthouse before the trial of Lee Boyd Malvo. (Rich Lipski/The Washington Post)\\r\\n\\r\\nVirginia has argued twice (and lost twice) that the judge in Malvo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case had the discretion to reduce the jury\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life term for capital murder to something less. In 2017, the Virginia Supreme Court ruled that life sentences in capital murder cases could be partially suspended. Cooley said that in 2003 \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceverybody in the state who did these things believed there was no prerogative for the judge. Certainly the judge didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cooley, who has tried dozens of capital murder cases and taught capital murder at the University of Richmond Law School, said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever did anybody suggest there anything other than the two options: death or life without parole.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRoush, who imposed the jury\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two life sentences in March 2004, is now retired. She declined to comment. Malvo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Supreme Court brief notes that Virginia \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas identified no case prior to Miller, and counsel is aware of none, in which a Virginia court sentenced a juvenile convicted of capital murder to anything less than life without parole.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For the Supreme Court case, Cooley recruited Washington lawyer Danielle Spinelli to lead Malvo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team. Spinelli was part of the team that persuaded the high court in 2005 to ban executions for juveniles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLee Boyd Malvo, now 34, in a recent photo from the Virginia Department of Corrections. He is serving life without parole at the Red Onion State Prison in Wise County, Va. (AP/AP)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA life-without-parole sentence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for a juvenile without considering a defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s maturity and changeability, Spinelli wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cviolates Miller whether it is \\xe2\\x80\\x98mandatory\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the 4th Circuit ruled that it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to decide whether Malvo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sentences were mandatory because the Montgomery case confirmed that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca sentencing judge also violates Miller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rule any time it imposes a discretionary life-without-parole sentence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d without first making a finding of permanent incorrigibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nFairfax County Commonwealth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Attorney Raymond F. Morrogh, who helped prosecute Malvo in 2003, said Virginia law has never prohibited judges from suspending part of a capital murder sentence, as it specifically does for other crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMorrogh noted that Malvo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s maturity and culpability were amply explored at his trial. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat was the crux of the defense argument for a month in front of the jury,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Morrogh said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a rare case that any juvenile should get a life sentence, but these were multiple killings. In my opinion, he was at least as bad as Muhammad. He sat there during the trial and drew pictures of [former Fairfax prosecutor] Bob [Horan] and me with targets on our backs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe case has attracted amicus briefs from significant parties on both sides. The Justice Department filed a brief in support of Virginia, and the court has granted the solicitor general time to participate in Wednesday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oral arguments.\\r\\n\\r\\nStone said the impact on the victims should not be overlooked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis affects lots of lives across the country,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stone said. He has represented victims whose juvenile offenders won resentencings in Maryland, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9csome ask for our help, some can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk when they stand up in court, and some don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to deal with it. Their whole life was changed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Bar Association and a group of former and current state and federal prosecutors and judges, to include former FBI and CIA director William Webster, filed briefs on behalf of Malvo, as did a group of crime victims including sniper victims Nichols, shooting survivor Paul LaRuffa and Cheryll Shaw, whose father Jerry Taylor was killed in Arizona in March 2002.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCraig S. Cooley, front, and Michael S. Arif, defense attorneys for Lee Boyd Malvo, after Malvo\\'s sentencing hearing in 2004. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\\r\\n\\r\\nLaRuffa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life was changed in September 2002, when he walked out of his Clinton, Md., restaurant, climbed into his car and then was shot five times by Malvo. Malvo then took $3,000 cash and LaRuffa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s laptop, which Muhammad used to plot subsequent violence. LaRuffa recovered, is now retired, and supports Malvo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI really agree there is a big difference between youth and adult offenders,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d LaRuffa said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I think they should be treated differently in the justice system. They have a better chance of being rehabilitated.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He said it was \\xe2\\x80\\x9chard when you use Malvo as an example,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because the sniper shootings were so horrific. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis case is for all juveniles. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reasonable to say if the death penalty for young people is off the table, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kind of the same reason life without parole is off the table.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d'\n",

Lobbyists and wonks say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible to imagine a path forward for Trump and Pelosi, who have both promised to take on the high cost of prescription drugs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what began as a bipartisan effort this year could easily fracture as political tensions rise \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and nothing ultimately happens to reduce the skyrocketing prices borne by American patients.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA bipartisan deal seems highly unlikely at this point,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Shawn Gremminger, senior director of federal relations for the liberal patient advocacy group Families USA, adding that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit was only ever going to happen with Trump leaning hard on wary Senate Republicans.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith that not likely at this point, it is hard to see how a compromise can actually happen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlus, progressive voices making the case to not \\xe2\\x80\\x98give Trump a win\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on drugs are only growing louder, meaning even that side is likely to back off.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBiden and his son Hunter Biden attend an NCAA basketball game in 2010.

      "b'We are all full of mucus, and not only because cold season is upon us. Our bodies produce a fresh liter of slime each day to coat our passages and tracts. Mucus may be gross, but its grossness disguises how helpful it is.\\r\\n\\r\\nA study published Monday in Nature Microbiology demonstrates one of mucus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 unexpected beneficial properties: Mucus contains sugars that keep potentially harmful germs in check.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiophysicist Katharina Ribbeck at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has spent more than a decade exploring the biochemistry that happens within mucus. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMucus piqued my interest because it is just this vastly understudied material that occupies a large surface area in our body,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ribbeck said. The gel lubricates the esophagus, lines the stomach, helps sperm move past the cervix, and guards nasal tissues.\\r\\n\\r\\nRibbeck and her colleagues study compounds called mucins in mucus. Mucins are long polymers, or molecular chains, densely studded with sugars. They \\xe2\\x80\\x9clook like mini bottlebrushes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ribbeck said, except bristling with sugar molecules where whiskers would be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMucus has for too long been considered bad in general public, but also in medicine,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gunnar C. Hansson, who studies mucin compounds at the Unversity of Gothenburg in Sweden and was not a member of the team behind the new work. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMucus and mucins are extremely complex to study and has been lagging almost all other types of biomedical research.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe textbook model of mucus \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a filter that traps and eliminates microbes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t entirely accurate. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe added microbes into mucus and we saw they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get trapped at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ribbeck said. Inside a glob of mucus, bacteria swim freely, in a state the scientist describes as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplanktonic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That helps our immune systems. A lone drifter, as opposed to many germs gathered in tough-to-penetrate clumps, makes an easier target for immune cells.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut not all bacteria need to be killed. Only a minority, in fact, are harmful. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have trillions of microbes growing outside and inside of our body,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ribbeck said. Microorganisms that live in the mucus of the digestive tract, for instance, help process food. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe provide the microbes the home, and in return, they do a service,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ribbeck said. Mucus, she suspected, might be part of the process that domesticates germs into friendlier inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\nKelsey Wheeler, a doctoral student in Ribbeck\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lab and a co-author of the paper, said that previous research showed purified mucins prevented several types of potentially harmful microbes from clumping up. The new study is the first, she said, to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cidentify that the glycan component\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 meaning, the sugars grafted to the mucins \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis responsible for suppressing antagonistic microbial behaviors.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scientists used several experiments to test the power of mucus. They embedded microbes in globs of mucus, what Ribbeck called \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca three-dimensional mucus matrix.\" They cultured germs alongside human epithelial cells and mucus sugars. And they used the sugars to heal infected burn wounds in pigs. (To gather enough mucus to study, researchers collected donations of human saliva and scraped out pig guts.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWheeler, Ribbeck and their colleagues tested how the sugars interacted with a bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The microbe does not normally cause disease, except when it infects people with cystic fibrosis or compromised immune systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scientists wanted to know whether sugars worked by themselves, so they shook the glycans free from the polymer. (Imagine snipping the whiskers off a bottlebrush.) Pseudomonas reacted to the sugars by becoming less infectious. The mucus compounds suppressed various genetic pathways in the bacteria including factors related to killing other microbes, toxin secretion, cell-cell communication and clump formation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMucus sugars are \\xe2\\x80\\x9clike pixie dust,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ribbeck said. \"Oh my goodness, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so active.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPediatrics professor Lars Bode, who studies sugars in breast milk at the University of California at San Diego and was not involved with this research, was intrigued by these abilities. Breast milk contains many small sugar molecules with similar structures, which Bode hypothesized may have similar effects when they are passed from mother to infant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cInstead of using antibiotics when these things turn against us, why don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we prevent them from turning against us in the first place?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bode said.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch not yet published suggests that the sugars can tame other types of microorganisms, including yeast and the bacteria Streptococcus mutans, Ribbeck said. The scientist was excited by the therapeutic potential of these molecules, she said, as more bacteria become resistant to drugs meant to kill them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cChanging their ability to cause infections could be a really potent strategy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ribbeck said.

      "b'In my private practice as a urologist, I recently saw a 64-year-old patient who I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been treating for several years for recurrent kidney stones. At this visit, however, she said that she now wakes up to urinate up to five times over the course of the night. The loss of sleep, she said, was causing major problems during the daytime in terms of her mood and productivity. She said she felt tired, depressed and was worried that the frequent trips to the bathroom might be a symptom of something more serious.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nSome urinary conditions or diseases can have multiple symptoms, one of them being nocturia, or the need to wake up several times during the night to urinate. The word nocturia comes from the Latin \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnox\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for night, and the Greek word for urine, \\xe2\\x80\\x9couria.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNocturia is more common as we age and affects both men and women. Women can start to experience nocturia as early as age 30. Beginning in their 50s and 60s, men and women experience nocturia at the same rate, regardless of their sex.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 1 in 3 people experience nocturia in their lifetime, and it is normal to wake up at some point during the night to urinate. Waking up several times a night, however, can affect your quality of life and, in some cases, be indicative of another problem, or a need for certain lifestyle changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re waking up during the night because you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re thirsty, anxious, or are in pain and also go to the bathroom \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the same as nocturia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nNocturia itself is easy to diagnose because it is simply the need to wake up several times at night to urinate over a period of time (not one night where you drank a lot of liquids, for instance). Nevertheless, it is more complicated to determine why a person needs to urinate frequently during the night, and depending on the underlying cause, it can range from easy to difficult to treat.\\r\\n\\r\\nI regularly see patients with mild to major anxiety and a list of possible ailments they are worried they may have after spending a night searching their symptoms on the Internet, going down a rabbit hole of information that can be anxiety producing for someone without a medical background.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe causes of nocturia can include a wide variety of underlying conditions. It can be as simple as caffeine and alcohol intake, medications, sleep conditions, a urinary tract infection or complications related to diabetes. In some cases, it can be indicative of a more serious condition such as congestive heart failure, kidney failure, or a bladder, urethra or a prostate tumor, among other possibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nMy 64-year-old patient ended up having a cystocele, otherwise known as a fallen or prolapsed bladder. We are now in the process of determining what is the best course of treatment for her, which can range from physical rehabilitation to surgery.\\r\\n\\r\\nNocturia can be a difficult issue to discuss because people often feel embarrassed bringing it up or are fearful of what might be wrong. While as a medical doctor I have to always consider the most serious potential causes of nocturia such as cancer or congestive heart failure, it could also be an enlarged prostate, a urinary tract infection or a symptom of a sleep condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the nocturia is caused by an enlarged prostate, there are a variety of ways to treat the condition. I have some patients with an enlarged prostate whom I treat with medication and others who require surgery. Treatment for urinary tract infections involves medication and dietary changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysicians walk a fine line between worrying patients unnecessarily and keeping them informed of the process of diagnosis and treatment. So, I always tell my patients that nocturia is, at a minimum, an annoyance that sometimes points to something more serious, which requires closer treatment and follow-up. Nocturia is a symptom that should not be taken lightly, but fearing the worst is a terrible reason not to see a doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you or a loved one are experiencing nocturia, I suggest seeing a urologist about the symptoms before your quality of life is affected. The physical, mental and emotional toll taken on us when we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what is going on with our bodies is much worse than a trip to the doctor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office to find out what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening and what we can do about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarcos Del Rosario-Santiago is a urologist in the Mexican navy and a member of the American Urological Association.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more\\r\\n\\r\\nAD'\n",

      "b'The court insisted on unanimous opinions, for instance, in critical civil rights cases, such as Brown v. Board of Education, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBrown II,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and Cooper v. Aaron, decisions that found school segregation to be unconstitutional and ordered school districts to desegregate. It had done the same in Ex parte Quirin, a 1942 case that had upheld the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of a military tribunal to try eight German saboteurs caught in the United States during World War II. We know from the justices\\xe2\\x80\\x99 private papers in each of these cases that it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that the justices each agreed with every word of the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinions; they simply agreed that the cases were important enough that they shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be determined by a divided vote, and that the reasoning shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be called into question through separate opinions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat principle also guided the court in 1974, when it ruled 8 to 0 (with Justice William Rehnquist recused) against President Richard Nixon at the height of the Watergate scandal and ordered him to comply with a subpoena issued by the special prosecutor, in a decision written, at least publicly, by Chief Justice Warren Burger \\xe2\\x80\\x94 whom Nixon himself had appointed. There was some debate within the White House over whether to comply and hand over the missing Watergate tapes, but the unanimity of the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling made clear that compliance was the only available outcome. Nixon turned over the recordings, and, thanks to the public impact of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csmoking gun\\xe2\\x80\\x9d tape, he resigned three weeks later.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the great unanswered questions about that Nixon episode is whether the president might have been more encouraged to defy a divided Supreme Court. Imagine, for example, a 5-to-3 decision where all three of the participating justices appointed by Nixon \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Burger, Harry Blackmun and Lewis Powell \\xe2\\x80\\x94 had dissented. Would Nixon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s political support have collapsed as quickly as it did? Would the Senate have voted to remove him if the House went on to impeach him?\\r\\n\\r\\nThat hypothetical is getting less hypothetical by the day. It looks increasingly likely that the Supreme Court will eventually be asked to resolve at least one of the many disputes in which President Trump has either ordered current or former officials to refuse to comply with congressional subpoenas or in which he is seeking to bar a third party from voluntarily complying.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only did the White House signal last Tuesday that it will no longer cooperate with any congressional requests, but the federal appeals court in Washington ruled Friday morning that the president could not block an accounting firm from turning over records of the work it has performed on Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behalf \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the first appellate ruling in one of these cases, setting the stage for a further appeal to the high court.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theory on which Trump has litigated these cases \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that Congress is not allowed to conduct any oversight of his conduct except through an impeachment inquiry that has been formally initiated \\xe2\\x80\\x94 represents a radical departure from long-settled understandings (including substantial prior Supreme Court precedent). It turns on the idea that before Congress can pursue any such oversight, it is required to formally vote to approve an impeachment inquiry, which is something that neither the Constitution, federal statutes nor the House\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own rules require. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why the district court had ruled against the president in the accounting firm case, a decision the D.C. Circuit affirmed by a 2-to-1 vote on Friday.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was the vote in favor of the president in the appellate case that seems foreboding: Judge Neomi Rao, whom Trump appointed this year to fill the seat previously held by Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, penned a 68-page dissent that broadly endorsed the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s core legal theory. As she wrote, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cImpeachment provides the exclusive method for Congress to investigate accusations of illegal conduct by impeachable officials, particularly with the aid of compulsory process.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In her view, the House is only allowed to issue subpoenas related to potential misconduct by the president of the United States once it has crossed a Rubicon that no law actually creates. And although Congress identified a \\xe2\\x80\\x9clegitimate legislative purpose\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the subpoena (a purpose the legitimacy of which Rao did not dispute), that was irrelevant because the subpoena also sought information relevant to whether the president has acted unlawfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that Rao is wrong (although she is). The problem is that the argument her dissent advances would previously have been seen as analytically indefensible, but now has the backing of a life-tenured Article III judge on what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s often described as the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9csecond-highest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d court. However unsupported the logic is by the Constitution\\xe2\\x80\\x99s text, American history or judicial precedent, Rao\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dissent normalizes Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s radical theory and thereby moves the Overton window, at least within conservative legal circles.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s especially significant here because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not likely that Rao was writing to convince her colleagues; even if Trump asks the full D.C. Circuit to reconsider Friday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s highly unlikely that a majority of the appeals court agrees with Rao\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unusual claims.\\r\\n\\r\\nRather, it seems that the audience for Rao\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dissent is the Supreme Court, including Justice Clarence Thomas (for whom she clerked). Indeed, feisty dissenting opinions in the courts of appeals often attract the attention of justices (and their clerks) and are sometimes even written much as advocates would write an application to the Supreme Court to take their appeal. One appellate judge has even gone so far as to coin a term for such opinions \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdissentals.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, the justices may never reach the merits of this dispute (or any of the other subpoena cases). We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re already well into the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s October 2019 term, and Trump could drag his feet on appealing Friday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling \\xe2\\x80\\x94 effectively keeping it from being enforced while also preventing the justices from taking up the case until their October 2020 term, when a decision would likely be mooted by the intervening congressional election (which, no matter who wins, will return a different Congress as of Jan. 3, 2021) even if it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mooted by the result of the presidential election. But Rao\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dissent certainly raises the possibility that, were the court to reach the merits of one of these cases, at least some of the justices might be similarly inclined. Now, at least, such a vote wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be the first, and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lengthy lower court opinion on which such a vote could rely.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that conclusion, in turn, provokes an alarming question: What if Trump loses one of these cases by a 5-to-4 vote, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. (about whom he has long been critical) joining the four justices appointed by Democratic presidents to produce a majority? Is it that far beyond the pale to imagine him defying a divided (as opposed to unanimous) court \\xe2\\x80\\x94 especially if such a decision comes after he is reelected? And would congressional Republicans defend the court in such an instance, as opposed to the leader of their own party? If the president were to defy such a Supreme Court ruling without meaningful cost, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not hard to see how much damage that would inflict upon the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s institutional authority, if not on the rule of law more generally.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are certainly those who think we are already in the midst of a constitutional crisis. But Friday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling provides an ominous harbinger of what might be the real constitutional crisis to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more:\\r\\n\\r\\nAD'\n",

      "b'\\r\\n\\r\\nA Quiche indigenous woman stands facing a monument that pays homage to migrants from the town of Salcaja, at the entrance to the town in Guatemala on Jun 7. (Moises Castillo/AP)\\r\\n\\r\\nLiz Ellis is an assistant professor of history at New York University and a citizen of the Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday more than 100 cities, including Minneapolis, Los Angeles and Santa Fe will commemorate Indigenous People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day with celebrations of their vibrant, contemporary Native communities and their heritage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis celebration of Indigenous People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day rather than Columbus Day has been decades in the making. Throughout most of the 20th century, U.S. schoolchildren were taught that Christopher Columbus \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiscovered\\xe2\\x80\\x9d America. However, in the 1990s a broad coalition of artists, activists, educators and Native Americans began to contest this narrative of European triumph. They advocated for an end to the commemoration of Columbus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 arrival and atrocities that his expedition committed against Caribbean Indigenous peoples, and instead for recognition of the cultural and historical contributions of America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Native peoples.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are critically important steps in decolonizing this holiday, but we need to think bigger. The importance of Indigenous People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day has always been rooted in the concept of visibility: reclaiming Native history and exposing historical injustices. This year we should recognize this holiday by demanding justice for Native people at the United States border.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis day of recognition is a critical component of the broader fight for justice in Native American communities. So many stories of our nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s origins present Native peoples as elements of a distant past, as though they were destined to fade into extinction. The combination of these national narratives of Native disappearance, along with the ubiquitous and stereotypical portrayals of Native Americans means that Indigenous people and communities are frequently rendered invisible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same thing has happened with Mayan, Lenca, Nahua-Pipil and other migrants from Central America. Narratives about their migration to the United States as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinvasion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d obscures the fact that many refugees and migrants from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and elsewhere, are also Native Americans. As such their connections and claims to this land predate many of our own.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor thousands of years before the creation of the United States and Mexico, Native people traded, traveled and lived across the lands where the international border between these two countries now stands. When the Spanish arrived on the Yucat\\xc3\\xa1n Peninsula in the early 16th century, Aztec trade routes extended as far south as Nicaragua today and north into what is now New Mexico, connecting the peoples across this region. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Caddo, Comanche and Apache people built towns and economies that spread across the lands of southern Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Sonora, Chihuahua and Coahuila.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not until 1848, at the close of the Mexican-American war, that the modern U.S. and Mexico border was created. This imperial border, negotiated by the two states, cut right through the homelands of existing Native nations. As the United States acquired an enormous section of what had been Mexico, it did so at the expense of Indigenous communities and by disrupting centuries-long relationships linking Indigenous people, lands and neighbors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States only hardened the U.S.-Mexico border in the 20th century with the creation of the Border Patrol in 1924 intent on controlling and restricting migration, mostly from Mexico. Subsequent mass deportations, including during the Great Depression, and later during Operation Wetback during the 1950s, reinforced the border further.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany Native nations have refused to recognize the United States\\xe2\\x80\\x99 northern and southern borders, however, and have argued that they split existing nations apart and ignore land claims that preexisted the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the north, they met some success. For centuries, Mohawks have fought U.S. and Canadian attempts to patrol, militarize and enforce the border that bisects their homelands along the St. Lawrence and St. Regis rivers. In the 1790s, the U.S. was forced to recognize the rights of Native people to migrate because of its position of military weakness and political vulnerability. The U.S. had to negotiate both with Native nations, like the Iroquois, and the British. Many Mohawk people today reject both U.S. and Canadian citizenship and travel instead on Iroquois passports, insisting on moving freely within their ancestral lands. The rights of Indigenous peoples whose nations are currently encompassed by Canada (First Nations) actually have explicit rights to cross this border to work, visit or live in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there is no comparable law or treaty that recognizes similar rights for southern Indigenous migrants. While the U.S. had negotiated a treaty in the north from a position of relative weakness, by the mid-19th century the U.S. had vastly expanded its military might, and was in the process of a genocidal campaign to remove and exterminate Indigenous peoples from lands in the Southeast and Southwest. Additionally, the development of new racial logics that excluded both Indigenous and Spanish-speaking people from participation in the American state and justified their dispossessions helped create the artificial divide between Indigenous peoples north and south of the 1848 border.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite U.S. claims to have completely conquered Indigenous lands, the continued existence of Native nations along the southern border and their persistence as Native nations on their original homelands challenges federal claims to exclusive territory and jurisdiction in this area.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd southern Native nations nonetheless continue to challenge the southern border and migration policies. For example, Tohono O\\xe2\\x80\\x99odham, whose lands and communities straddle the U.S. and Mexico border between Arizona and Sonora, have vehemently opposed the proposed extension of the border wall through their territories. The Tohono O\\xe2\\x80\\x99odham lived on these lands for thousands of the years before the birth of the United States, and the proposed expansion of the border wall constitutes a direct assault on their sovereignty in their homelands. In 2017, as the Trump administration ratcheted up its efforts, Verlon Jose, the Vice Chairman of Tohono O\\xe2\\x80\\x99odham, powerfully rejected the federal governments\\xe2\\x80\\x99 claims to exert their borders over his peoples\\xe2\\x80\\x99 homelands. As he put it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnly over my dead body will a wall be built.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready far too many Indigenous bodies have been sacrificed along the increasingly militarized U.S.-Mexico border. Between 2003 and 2018, 97 migrants died either in the custody of or at the hands of U.S. and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Since 1994, an estimated 8,300 people have died attempting to cross the border, and as the federal government has ramped up immigration enforcement in recent years these crossings have become more dangerous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese dangers fall disproportionately on Indigenous people, who often face little choice but to migrate to escape state sanctioned violence and enduring discrimination in their countries. Just last year, Claudia G\\xc3\\xb3mez Gonz\\xc3\\xa1lez, an Indigenous woman from the highlands of Guatemala, who had glossy black hair and a shy smile, was shot and killed by a CBP agent as she stood in vacant lot in Rio Bravo. In December of 2018, seven-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin, whose primary language was Q\\xe2\\x80\\x99eqhi, a Mayan dialect, died of dehydration and septic shock in U.S. custody, and in May 16-year-old Hernandez Vasquez, who was Maya Achi, became the fifth child to die in U.S. custody since December 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo truly honor contemporary Indigenous people and dismantle the imperial legacy of Columbus, we should recognize people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s human right to migrate and to move across borders that historically crossed them. People should not be detained in cages for seeking a better life, and they deserve justice. Therefore, in addition to supporting local celebrations of Native heritage and culture, we should also be supporting organizations that support the rights of Indigenous migrants and refugees like RAICES and New Sanctuary Coalition, and calling our representatives to demand political reform to protect all migrants and refugees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s do something meaningful for the Indigenous peoples of the Americas.'\n",

      "b'\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Trump speaks to members of the media at the White House on Saturday. (Al Drago/Bloomberg News)\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniel Hemel is an assistant professor of law at the University of Chicago.\\r\\n\\r\\nA federal appeals court in Washington on Friday ordered President Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s longtime accounting firm to hand over stacks of financial documents to congressional investigators. When that dispute reaches the Supreme Court later this year, the justices will face a crucial choice: whether to schedule oral argument promptly and pave the way for a final ruling by summertime, or instead delay a decision until after next year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s general election.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe high court should not let Trump run out the clock. But if a bare majority of the justices wished to, they could.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe case involves a subpoena issued April 15 by the House Oversight Committee to the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accountants, Mazars USA, for financial statements they prepared on behalf of Trump, his trust and foundation and several Trump-owned businesses from 2011 through 2018. The subpoena also calls for \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[a]ll underlying, supporting, or source documents and records\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that the accountants used when producing those statements. That demand potentially encompasses Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long-elusive tax returns if Mazars relied on them when preparing his statements.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Trump just gave the House a very good reason to look at his tax returns]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven days after House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) sent the subpoena to Mazars, Trump sued his accountants in federal district court in Washington to stop them from complying with the congressional demand. Judge Amit P. Mehta made quick work of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claims, ruling on May 20 that the subpoena was enforceable immediately. Trump sought relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and the appeals court put Mehta\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling on ice temporarily while it took up the case. It, too, proceeded at a fast clip, holding a rare summer oral argument on July 12 and issuing its decision just shy of three months later.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout strong legal arguments and with the general election fast approaching, Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best strategy now is to stall. D.C. Circuit rules give Trump 30 days to ask for a rehearing before the three-judge panel that initially decided his appeal or before all 11 active judges on the circuit court. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unlikely that the panel or the full circuit will grant Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request, but 30 days from last Friday, the general election will be less than a year away.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the D.C. Circuit resolves the rehearing petition, Trump will have \\xe2\\x80\\x94 according to the appeals court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order \\xe2\\x80\\x94 seven more days before Mehta\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling takes effect. During that window, the president will scramble to obtain a stay either from the D.C. Circuit or the Supreme Court. He will argue that the ruling against him should be placed on hold while he petitions the justices to hear his case. His lawyers will say \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not unreasonably \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that without a stay, the case would become moot because Mazars would have to hand over the documents to Congress before the justices could weigh in.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf he obtains the stay, Trump may well have won his war against time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe losing party in a lower-court case has 90 days to file a certiorari petition, potentially allowing Trump to wait until late February to seek Supreme Court review. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not all, because the court typically takes several more weeks to consider amicus briefs, the winning party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response, and the losing party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reply before it decides whether to grant the petition. Washington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cherry blossoms may be in full bloom before we even know whether the Supreme Court will hear the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Trump lied to me about his wealth to get on the Forbes 400. Here are the tapes.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that point, the next opening on the Supreme Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regular oral argument schedule will likely not be until the beginning of the next term, Oct. 5, 2020, when early voting will have started in several states and the general election will be just four weeks away. By the time the court releases its opinion, Trump either could have already taken the oath of office a second time, or he could be out of the White House and licking his electoral wounds at his Mar-a-Lago resort.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut such delay need not be destiny. The justices can allow Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawyers to idle \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or they can put the case on a much faster timetable and resolve it well before voters must decide whether to reelect the president.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the justices choose to move quickly, the case could proceed as follows. When Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawyers seek a stay from the Supreme Court, the justices could \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as they did in Bush v. Gore \\xe2\\x80\\x94 construe the stay application as a petition for certiorari and grant review immediately. (Alternatively, they could deny Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stay application and his request for further review \\xe2\\x80\\x94 concluding that Mehta and the D.C. Circuit have given his arguments all their due \\xe2\\x80\\x94 though they may decide, not unjustifiably, that a high-profile dispute between the president and the legislature ought to be resolved finally by the highest court in the land.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe justices could then order the parties to file briefs on an expedited time frame and hold oral argument this winter. That would allow for a final decision well before the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s summer recess, which typically begins in late June or early July. If the justices rule in the House\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favor, then the Oversight Committee would have plenty of time to review Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial documents and decide what should be released to the public before the election.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is ample precedent for this accelerated approach. In the 1971 Pentagon Papers case, the Supreme Court issued its final decision a little more than two weeks after the first district court hearing. In United States v. Nixon in 1974, just over three months passed from the special prosecutor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subpoena for the White House tapes and the Supreme Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s final ruling. In Bush v. Gore, then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush asked the Supreme Court for a stay on a Friday, and the court heard oral argument the following Monday and issued its decision on Tuesday. The wheels of justice usually turn slowly, but the court can spin them much faster when the stakes are high and time is of the essence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether the court speeds up its consideration of the Mazars case will have subtle but significant implications for the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches. If the Supreme Court allows itself to be used by Trump to stave off congressional inquiries, then the practical power of the presidency will expand even if the ultimate decision goes in the House\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favor. If the justices act quickly to resolve document disputes between the president and lawmakers, then the court will enhance the efficacy of congressional oversight and bolster an important check on executive branch misconduct.\\r\\n\\r\\nLegally, there is little that the House can do to force the high court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand. Public opinion can, however, judge the justices based on their pace as well as the result they reach. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is increasingly the swing vote on a sharply divided court, no doubt knows that this case will be central to the legacy that he leaves. Upholding the House\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subpoena power will help Roberts counter charges that he has been too pliant to this president \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but only if his court reaches its result in time for it to matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy California\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan to get Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tax returns won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work\\r\\n\\r\\nFive myths about Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s income tax returns\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impeachment defense boils down to this: Treat me like a king'\n",

This decision has prompted outrage and condemnation from politicians on both sides of the political aisle, as well as the United States\\xe2\\x80\\x99 traditional allies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kurdish forces in question were crucial in the fight against ISIS, and onlookers fear that Turkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s military operation will cause yet another humanitarian crisis in Syria. As Turkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s air force has launched airstrikes, prompting civilians to flee, opponents are scrambling to come up with a way to reverse the Turkish onslaught and protect the Kurds. Some in the region, such as the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), have begun to call for the creation of an internationally backed no-fly zone, calls that may only increase after Turkey bombed American Special Forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo-fly zones, which date back to the 1991 Persian Gulf War, are a physical area in which aircraft are prevented from flying by the air power of another, stronger sovereign state or coalition, and while they often have multiple goals, one is usually to protect vulnerable populations from assault. Their history indicates that no-fly zones have unintended consequences and that keeping them limited to a humanitarian mission is often hard, suggesting that they may not be the best solution for the problems in northeastern Syria today.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first no-fly zones, created over northern and southern Iraq by the George H.W. Bush administration in the early 1990s, variously served three purposes: civilian protection, containment and a push for regime change.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first of these zones, launched in April 1991 as part of the fallout from the Gulf War, covered territory in northern Iraq above the 36th parallel. Encouraged by Bush, Shiites in the south and Kurds in the north had risen up against the Iraqi government as the war ended. The Bush administration, however, was wary of fracturing the anti-Iraqi coalition, which had achieved its mission of repelling Iraq from Kuwait, and of inadvertently partitioning Iraq, which enabled Saddam Hussein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regime to cling to power. This ambivalence allowed Hussein to begin extracting vengeance on the Kurds and the Shiites rising up to oppose his rule.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crisis in northern Iraq soon became so acute that Bush was forced to launch a reluctant but successful humanitarian intervention, Operation Provide Comfort, which spawned the April 1991 no-fly zone. Its purpose was initially to defend British and American pilots as they flew aid to Kurdish refugees. But, as the Bush administration withdrew its ground troops from Iraq, the zone soon took on the role of protecting Kurdish civilians from Hussein. The no-fly zone, policed by regular coalition military patrols, achieved this goal by putting a stop to Hussein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s air force using helicopters against the Kurds, which it had been doing because of poor postwar planning.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the no-fly zone was not without unintended geopolitical ramifications. Principle among these was facilitating the emergence of the Kurdistan Regional Government \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a de facto Kurdish state in northern Iraq. This development deeply worried America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ally Turkey, which feared the separatist impulse among its own Kurdish population. As the base for the aircraft operating the no-fly zone, Turkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s involvement was key to the operation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s existence, and it often took skillful diplomacy on the part of the Bush administration to keep the deterrent in place.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 1992 the Bush administration created a second no-fly zone, this one over southern Iraq, ostensibly to protect the Shiites from Hussein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s continued vengeance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile both no-fly zones were envisioned as short-term measures, each ended up lasting more than a decade as successive U.S. governments struggled to deal with the Hussein regime. The geopolitical cost was often high: The stationing of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia to run the no-fly zones antagonized powerful forces in the region, including al-Qaeda, helping to precipitate terrorist attacks against the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite this high cost, little analysis of the no-fly zones took place. Both at the time and in the years since they have been presented uncritically as straightforward humanitarian interventions. The reality, however, is that no-fly zones were and remain multifaceted tools. Even when they have humanitarian goals, they also have political objectives.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the first northern zone furthered humanitarian goals by limiting Hussein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to persecute Kurds, from the beginning it also allowed the United States and its allies to punish Iraq for its continued refusal to identify and destroy its weapons of mass destruction, despite a United Nations decree ordering that process. The traditional narrative holds that only later, in 1996, did the northern no-fly zone become more about containing Hussein than protecting the Kurds. But in reality the Bush administration had realized early on that the zone represented a significant impingement on Iraq\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sovereignty and freedom of action.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe punitive potential of no-fly zones was expanded by the creation of the no-fly zone over southern Iraq in August 1992. Again, duel purposes were at work: Bush and his allies publicly voiced concern about the ever-worsening plight of the Shiites, but their main goal was to extract a price for Hussein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s refusal to allow U.N.-mandated weapons inspections. In fact, the new no-fly zone was meant to be just one part of a wider anti-Hussein operation enacted in August 1992, but the plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pi\\xc3\\xa8ce de r\\xc3\\xa9sistance, a significant bombing campaign against Iraq, had to be abandoned after damaging leaks from within the State Department embarrassed the Bush administration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe leaks were tied to a third purported goal of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9crenewal of hostilities,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as the administration called it: domestic politics. Allegedly, the administration wanted to provoke Iraq into a confrontation timed to coincide with the start of the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are going to stage an incident,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one of the leakers claimed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto help get the President reelected.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout the planned broader campaign, the no-fly zone became the primary new weapon for punishing Hussein. It proved entirely ineffective at protecting the Shiites, who faced a significant ground-based threat. While the northern no-fly zone had protected the Kurds, the geographic and political circumstances were completely different in the south. This difference illuminated how no-fly zones were not a one-size-fits-all solution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat has remained true: Since the Iraqi zones were implemented, only two more no-fly zones have been created \\xe2\\x80\\x94 each by a U.S.-led NATO coalition \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and both produced mixed records. A no-fly zone operated over Bosnia by the Clinton administration proved ineffective at protecting civilians and a 2011 no-fly zone over Libya, created by the Obama administration, has proved to be highly controversial. While justified by the Obama administration on humanitarian grounds, the no-fly zone played a role in the ouster and execution of Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi, prompting charges that it was designed to engineer regime change.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sum total of these experiences teaches us that no-fly zones have always had unintended geopolitical consequences. However well-intentioned, a no-fly zone in northeastern Syria could exacerbate problems in the region or produce repercussions for the West, especially the United States. While stopping Turkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attack on the Kurds is a worthwhile goal, a no-fly zone offers more risks than rewards.\"\n",

The woman who posted the clip gives a thumbs-up in the hat that marks her as an employee of Panera Bread.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe caption on video-sharing app TikTok: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexposing panera.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clip brought a wave of gripes last week from disillusioned customers of a chain known for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfast casual\\xe2\\x80\\x9d dining typically perceived as a step above fast food in quality. Commenters said they expected more than warmed-from-frozen dishes, or \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as one critic put it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cglorified hospital food.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the fallout went both ways, the woman behind the video said, announcing Friday via her newly famous Twitter account: \\xe2\\x80\\x9clol i lost my job for this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nApparently, this is how Panera Bread prepares the mac and cheese. (via TikTok) pic.twitter.com/jUv47TYBhm \\xe2\\x80\\x94 UberFacts (@UberFacts) October 11, 2019\\r\\n\\r\\nPanera Bread spokeswoman Jessica Hesselschwerdt declined to discuss personnel matters but told The Washington Post that the company has confirmed the TikTok video\\xe2\\x80\\x99s authenticity. In a statement, the company defended its preparation methods, explaining its mac and cheese is still a patently Panera product \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmade offsite with our proprietary recipe developed by our chefs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is shipped frozen to our bakery cafes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 this allows us to avoid using preservatives which do not meet our clean standards,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the company said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany restaurants are reluctant to admit to heating up frozen food. After a survey of French restaurants found one-third acknowledged serving frozen items, some in the industry said the true number was probably higher because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchefs were embarrassed to admit the short cuts that, in effect, hoodwink their customers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as The Post reported.\\r\\n\\r\\nPanera often joins popular chains such as Chipotle and Shake Shack under the label \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfast casual.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fast casual eateries \\xe2\\x80\\x9coffer consumers freshly-prepared, higher-quality food in an informal setting, with counter service to keep things speedy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the website Investopedia explains.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe two stalwarts of the American restaurant industry were always fast-food and fine dining, but now the rapidly growing fast-casual restaurant sector has squeezed in between them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the site adds, though it notes the industry is still dwarfed by traditional fast-food companies such as McDonald\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some critics, the TikTok video\\xe2\\x80\\x99s depiction of mac-and-cheese preparation was at odds with Panera\\xe2\\x80\\x99s image. Others were less surprised, though, chiming in with their stories of food prep from other chains. Some felt vindicated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve said before that Panera bread Mac and cheese is garbage, and here is the proof,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a Twitter user posted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there were the people who declared they love Panera mac and cheese anyway \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and wondered what all the fuss was about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how almost all chain restaurants cook and serve their food,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one person commented. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called efficiency.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOMG PANERA BREAD MAC AND CHEESE IS FROZEN???

Panera serves more than 3 million mac-and-cheese servings each month, according to the company.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe identity of the woman who posted the video is unclear, and she did not respond to an inquiry from The Post.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer latest tweets suggest a silver lining in the alleged firing, which has brought even more publicity: \\xe2\\x80\\x9csince it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blowing up again go follow my socials,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said Saturday.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more:\\r\\n\\r\\nHow four dishes with roots in other lands tell a story of immigration\\r\\n\\r\\nWho says you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t eat red meat?

      "b'Approaching its 150th birthday Nov. 6, college football has developed a hefty share of ancient truths. One is its persistent revelation that we, the people, are so susceptible to the razzmatazz of offense as to be insufficiently appreciative of defenders. Another is the curious reality that the sport\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bushels of lopsided rivalries wind up lending more magic to upsets when those rivalries do go upturned. Both truths turned up Saturday in the upset of the year, in the Athens less ancient than that other Athens.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefenders long have protected Saturday night moods in American college towns, preventing our despicable rivals from marring our dreams and entitlements. Yet of the 81 Heisman trophies, we have managed to give just one to a player primarily a defender, and that guy had to return punts and catch 11 passes to help surmount the bias.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s with joy, then, that we can extol from the masses of semi-anonymous defenders of Saturday one Israel Mukuamu, \\xc2\\xad6-foot-4 cornerback, South Carolina. Before the Gamecocks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 astonishing 20-17, double-overtime road upset of then-No. 3 Georgia that helped South Carolina budge to 3-3, Bulldogs quarterback Jake Fromm had zero interceptions and one turn of expert praise from Notre Dame Coach Brian Kelly, who described Fromm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rarefied precision in avoiding turnovers.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Fromm has thrown three interceptions, all to Israel Mukuamu.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Ryan Hilinski lost a brother to suicide. Now he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also a college QB and honoring his memory.]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo were not just interceptions but some of the better catches on display this entire mad autumn. Mukuamu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 53-yard interception return just before halftime not only stemmed from Javon Kinlaw\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rush toward Fromm, and not only provided a 17-10 lead that stuck around a long time, but featured Mukuamu lurching skyward to his left to snare the ball, then staying in bounds before making his merry trip up the sideline. The second, with 9:25 left, involved an outstretched snare with a stunning turn of dexterity at keeping the ball above the grass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third, a reacting catch off a tip, happened in the first overtime, which was handy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a fantastic player and uncharacteristic,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d South Carolina Coach Will Muschamp told reporters about his towering cornerback, who switched from safety this past offseason and once tweeted: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c6\\xe2\\x80\\x994\\xe2\\x80\\x9d playing corner? Yeah I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m about to change the game!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Further, Mukuamu credited his teammates by telling reporters that Georgia had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnever played a D-line like us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the kind of crazy-confident comment that can occur in only about 130 of the 130 Football Bowl Subdivision programs.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill further, here are some biographical morsels about a defensive player: The family moved from South Carolina to Louisiana, where Mukuamu finished high school, then the three-star recruit committed to Florida State, then Jimbo Fisher left Florida State for Texas A&M, then Mukuamu headed for South Carolina. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what Mukuamu, a polite man and an eager student, told South Carolina reporters in August: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI remember one time in third grade, I had a C, and my mom, actually my parents, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let me play football that year.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, a third-grade C can wind up ruining an Athens night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat three-touchdown-underdog South Carolina got outgained 468-297, and out-possessed 36:04-23:56, and out-snapped 95-68 proved again how turnovers do matter so much in American life and added further shock to the only occasion Saturday that altered the College Football Playoff landscape up ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\n[College football winners and losers: LSU proves formidable and relentless]\\r\\n\\r\\nElsewhere, entertaining form held. LSU and its dazzling new passing game ought to be ranked No. 1 after surpassing Florida, \\xc2\\xad42-28, on a Baton Rouge night in which the impressive teams included LSU (6-0) and Florida (6-1). LSU quarterback Joe Burrow completed 21 passes in but 24 tries, and the LSU denizens, for so long forlorn without the fun passes thrown in other towns, looked positively rapturous as star wide receiver Ja\\xe2\\x80\\x99Marr Chase streamed up the right sideline on the 54-yard touchdown that closed the scoring.\\r\\n\\r\\nOklahoma (6-0) looked fascinating while beating Texas. Alabama (6-0) won at Texas A&M but left Coach Nick Saban prattling about the \\xe2\\x80\\x9crat poison\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of complacency from the praise that comes from those who see Alabama and notice excellence. Baylor found 6-0 with a double-overtime win over Texas Tech that provided the fans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 dream of a controversial call (on an apparent Baylor fumble in the first overtime), as controversial calls alleviate the tedium of everyday conversation for weeks and months to come while providing much-craved pique. Wisconsin (6-0) continued such steely command with its 38-0 wallop of faded Michigan State, and Minnesota (6-0) continued such steady growth in its 34-7 wallop of Nebraska, so does all that mean there might come a humongous Paul Bunyan Axe game Nov. 30 in Minneapolis?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere might.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt certainly means that Wisconsin at Ohio State on Oct. 26 looks plump with pregame anticipation, and it certainly spurs a reminder, especially after a week in which Minnesota prepared for game-time cold by dousing its players with wintry water as they took the practice field.\\r\\n\\r\\nReminder: Many have dismissed Minnesota Coach P.J. Fleck as a flake, and if a guy who led Western Michigan to a 13-1 record and a No. 1 national ranking in turnover margin, and now has Minnesota at 6-0, is a flake, then may we all seek flake-dom.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, at another long day-and-night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s end, the deepest truth lurked somewhere in that presumably merry night in Columbia, the South Carolina capital. Yes, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eccentric that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a sport that draws hundreds of thousands of people to stadiums to witness conclusions that so often seem foregone. Yes, Georgia held a \\xc2\\xad51-18-2 lead in that border rivalry coming in. Yes, as Georgia has revved up under its alumnus Kirby Smart, seemingly rendering post-Spurrier South Carolina a map dot again as Georgia alumnus Muschamp started out, and the past four meetings had gone 52-20, 28-14, 24-10 and 41-17.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet without all those realities and all that time apparently wasted spent traveling to, parking for and watching them (except at tailgates, where time is never wasted), the upset of Saturday would not have mattered with such oomph. A country that considered the noon matchup an afterthought would not have known the pleasure of being amazed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even given that Georgia still can access the playoff, the way these national champions did: Ohio State in 2014 when it lost to Virginia Tech, Alabama in 2015 when it lost to Mississippi, Clemson in 2016 when it lost to Pittsburgh, Alabama in 2017 when it lost to Auburn. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even given Saturday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s downer of an ending, when the great Georgia senior kicker Rodrigo Blankenship missed a 42-yard field goal on the last play. That led the winning coach, Muschamp, to begin his postgame comments with: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRodrigo Blankenship is and has been an unbelievable representative of the University of Georgia and kicker, and my heart goes out to him in losing in that fashion. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an outstanding young man and about all the right things in college athletics.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn so many Saturdays in college football, you wake up and you know what will happen, but then some Saturdays, it turns out you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Some days, a program standing 18-51-2 against another goes and finds its nemesis at one of its historic peaks yet wins inexplicably, with three interceptions from a giant named Israel and one gracious comment from an underdog coach about a distinguished kicker.'\n",

      "b'The viable fantasy defenses of the Steelers, Buccaneers and Browns are also unavailable, perhaps forcing you to find a defensive/special teams replacement for the week.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne team that could pick up steam during the second half of the season is the New York Jets. After they face the New England Patriots next Monday night, the Jets will meet the Jacksonville Jaguars, Miami Dolphins, New York Giants, Washington Redskins, Oakland Raiders, Cincinnati Bengals and then Miami again, teams that are a combined 8-26. Jets wideouts Jamison Crowder (available in 48 percent of fantasy leagues) and Robby Anderson (41 percent) are solid pickups if they are still available, as is quarterback Sam Darnold (73 percent).

The Chiefs defense isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t helping Andy Reid win games, but it might help you. Before Sunday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loss to the Houston Texans, the Chiefs produced three or more sacks in three of their previous four games. Next week, they face a Denver Broncos team that is scoring a below-average 1.6 points per drive with a corresponding below-average passer rating (87.4). Denver also comes away with a red-zone touchdown on less than half its trips inside the 20-yard line (47 percent). This is a matchup play, but the matchup is favorable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIto Smith, RB, Atlanta Falcons (Available in 61 percent of fantasy leagues)\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes it pays to have a touchdown vulture on your roster, and this season Smith fits the bill. The second-year pro leads the Falcons with four goal-line carries, although he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only scored on one. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also caught 11 of 14 targets for 87 yards out of the backfield.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Los Angeles Rams, he will be facing a defense that has allowed touchdowns on six of 20 goal-to-go carries, tied for second-most in the NFL.

      "b'\\r\\n\\r\\nA loss to the Jets did not leave Cowboys owner Jerry Jones at a loss for words. (Adam Hunger/Associated Press)\\r\\n\\r\\nA lot can change in three weeks in the NFL. Just ask Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, whose team lost its third straight game on Sunday, falling to the previously winless New York Jets in what Jones admitted was \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca bloody nose to us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter his team opened the season with three straight wins, Jones has cast aside thoughts of NFL-wide dominance and, at least for the moment, is looking at the NFC East and calculating how to conquer it, starting with Sunday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s game against the Philadelphia Eagles. Both teams are 3-3.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all about where you end up in your division,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jones told reporters Sunday evening at MetLife Stadium. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think the competition against each other and the competition within the division, I think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where it all is.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, ultimately, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re one of the really top teams, which we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not, we are not \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I hope that someday this season we could be one of the top teams. We certainly were not tonight. I hope that we can do better than just win our division, although I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take that right now in this circumstance. But I hope that we can get out there and get a little special positioning in the playoffs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cowboys and Eagles go into Sunday night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s game at AT&T Stadium tied atop the division, with the Giants at 2-4 and Redskins 1-5. At the moment, the Cowboys hold the tiebreaker because of a better record in the division, but the season isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t halfway over yet and the first round of divisional matchups hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been completed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis was a big game for us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jones said of the 24-22 loss to the Jets. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEvery one in your division is big, but this was a big game. We could\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been 4-2 \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re 5-0 and 1-4. We suffered another loss because of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bloody nose to us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n[John Clayton: These five NFL contenders are at risk of missing the playoffs]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe loss fell on the 77th birthday of a man who has made no secret that he wants to win a Super Bowl ASAP and it marked the first time since 1999 that the Cowboys had lost to an opponent with an 0-4 or worse record. It also marked the Cowboys\\xe2\\x80\\x99 first three-game losing streak since late in the 2017 season.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs eager as he is to get to a Super Bowl, Jones said that Coach Jason Garrett\\xe2\\x80\\x99s job isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in jeopardy. Garrett has gone to the playoffs three times in nine seasons, but has never gotten past the divisional round.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be very trite. I was a lot happier with what he had done the first three games than what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened the last three games,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jones said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut the big thing I want to say is it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just him. This is across the board. That had a lot of input out there tonight to get in that spot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nGarrett is in the last year of his contract and Jones has shown no inclination to change that. Told last week that oddsmakers ranked Garrett behind only Atlanta\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Dan Quinn on the list of coaches likely to be fired, Jones replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bet any money [on] that happening. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll lose it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cowboys\\xe2\\x80\\x99 offense has been slowed by injuries on its vaunted offensive line, among other things. Their record is the same was it was last year after six games, but expectations were higher this season.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you really look at it, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take one thing. It can be a list of 15 things, with some having more of an emphasis on maybe the player, the execution, mistakes, breaks \\xe2\\x80\\x94 all of those kinds of things,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jones said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAcross the board, we did not play well enough to win. Had we been able to tie this thing up, or win that thing at the end, it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be because we played well.

      "b'Seven of last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s postseason teams appear to be solidly in playoff contention, if not bona fide Super Bowl contenders: the New England Patriots, New Orleans Saints, Seattle Seahawks, Kansas City Chiefs, Baltimore Ravens, Houston Texans and even the Andrew Luck-less Indianapolis Colts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n(We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re giving the Chiefs a pass, for now, despite back-to-back home losses to the Colts and Texans, who found a way to slow Patrick Mahomes. Defenses are matching up more in man-to-man coverage against Kansas City, and Houston quarterback Deshaun Watson burned the Chiefs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 porous run defense as well as through the passing game Sunday. Still, the Chiefs are clearly the most talented AFC West team and will win the division. Coach Andy Reid will find a way to run the ball better and make life easier for Mahomes.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what about the remaining five? We ranked them from most cause for concern, to least.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Los Angeles Chargers\\r\\n\\r\\nThey dropped to 2-4 after a Sunday night loss to a Pittsburgh Steelers team starting its rookie third-string quarterback \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a stunning fall for a team that was 12-4 a season ago, averaging 27 points per game and allowing just 20.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the past two weeks have exposed so many problems. First, you start with the injuries. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect to lose left tackle Russell Okung, center Mike Pouncey and safety Derwin James to injuries, miss halfback Melvin Gordon for four games with a holdout and wait for five weeks to get back tight end Hunter Henry from a knee injury and expect a repeat of a 12-win season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Trent Scott-Sam Tevi tandem at offensive tackle isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t working out. The receiving corps has been banged up. Rivers is struggling in the red zone and the offense is averaging 20 points a game and has been shut out in the first half of the past two games.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make matters worse, the Chargers are 1-3 at home with a three-game losing streak and have had more opposing fans at their games than Charger fans. The AFC provides more opportunity to catch up in the playoff race than the NFC does, but the Chargers have reason to worry.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Los Angeles Rams\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a 3-0 start, the Rams have fallen to third place in the NFC West and are on a three-game losing streak. More concerning is how the Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers have caught up to them after they had such a position of dominance in the division.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 49ers totally neutralized Sean McVay\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offense in Sunday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 20-7 victory at the Coliseum. McVay still hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t found answers to the problems defenses have caused for them since the Detroit Lions put up a six-man defensive front against them last year in early December \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a model the Patriots replicated in their Super Bowl victory. Take away the running attack, and you take away the key to an offense that can score more than 30 points a game.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sunday, the 49ers primarily used a four-man rush to limit the Rams to 109 meaningless yards rushing and held Jared Goff to 13 of 24 passing for 78 yards. Todd Gurley was out with a groin injury, but when healthy he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been bad in pass-blocking and hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t had more than 16 carries in any game this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rams clearly look like the third-best team in their division \\xe2\\x80\\x94 something no one would have expected even three weeks ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Chicago Bears\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 3-2, the Bears are still in a strong position to make the playoffs, but they have to worry about the competitive NFC North, with all four teams having winning records. The Green Bay Packers really improved their pass rush with the additions of Preston Smith and Za\\xe2\\x80\\x99Darius Smith, and of course, they have Aaron Rodgers at quarterback.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nChicago feasted on the league\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easiest schedule during last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 12-4 campaign, but this year it has one of the four toughest. The offensive line has struggled and quarterback Mitchell Trubisky was up and down before suffering a clavicle injury. The Bears could have a tough time earning a wild-card spot if the Packers run away with the division title.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Dallas Cowboys and Philadelphia Eagles (tie)\\r\\n\\r\\nI put these two teams together because they are both 3-3 and face each other next Sunday night. The loser will drop to 3-4. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a problem, because the combined records of their next six opponents are 22-8 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 meaning the team that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win the NFC East could have a hard time earning a wild-card bid.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Eagles, the biggest problem is injuries, particularly on defense. Starting cornerbacks Ronald Darby and Avonte Maddox are hurt and cornerbacks Rasul Douglas and Sidney Jones have been inconsistent in coverage. They are thin at linebacker and banged up along the offensive line.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Cowboys, the answer appears to be simple: We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve overhyped them. They started the season 3-0 against teams that had combined records of 3-14. Offensive coordinator Kellen Moore was able to get away with more creative plays than this offense has seen in years because the defenses they faced weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t any good. Over the recent three-game losing streak, the Cowboys are averaging 19 points a game, after averaging 32 the first three games. Injuries at offensive tackle haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t helped, and the defense, which is very talented, is simply giving up too many yards and points.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the third straight year the Cowboys are 3-3 after six weeks under Coach Jason Garrett, who is in the final year of his contract.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the NFL\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to see why the Cleveland Browns are 2-4. I was on their sideline for their 32-28 loss to Seattle, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clear that they are their own worst enemy. They suffer way too many self-inflicted wounds on offense. Maybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unfair, but much of that points back to first-year coach Freddie Kitchens.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe offensive line, which isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t good, commits too many penalties that put Baker Mayfield into tough down-and-distance situations. Pass-catching has been inconsistent despite having Pro Bowlers Odell Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landry. Balls keep bouncing off the hands of Cleveland pass catchers and into the hands of defenders.\\r\\n\\r\\nCleveland has a bye week followed by a road game at New England followed by a schedule that gets much more manageable in the second half. With team owner Jimmy Haslam being at recent practices, you have to wonder if Kitchens will make it to a second season.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hot seat just got hotter for Atlanta Falcons Coach Dan Quinn. The Falcons are 1-5 after a 34-33 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. While a coaching change might not happen in the next week, something could happen by their bye in Week 9. The Falcons have home games coming up against the Rams and the Seahawks. The defense is giving up more than 30 points a game.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter six weeks, Russell Wilson is the league MVP. He is carrying a team that is still figuring things out on defense to a 5-1 start. On Sunday, he patiently brought the team from behind to win at Cleveland. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s completing 72.5 percent of his passes for 1,704 yards and has 14 touchdown passes and no interceptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s becoming clearer there will be QB changes in Carolina, Tampa Bay and Tennessee. With Cam Newton out with a foot injury, Panthers quarterback Kyle Allen won his fourth consecutive start in London to beat the Buccaneers, 37-26. Newton is 0-8 in his past eight starts. In a 16-0 loss to the Denver Broncos, Titans QB Marcus Mariota was benched in favor of Ryan Tannehill. Jameis Winston threw five interceptions and had a lost fumble in the loss to Carolina, bringing his career total to 87 turnovers. Odds are narrowing for Mariota and Winston getting contract extensions. They are free agents after this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDuck\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Devlin Hodges story isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite Gardner Minshew mania, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s close. Pittsburgh\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rookie third-string QB only threw the ball further than 10 yards downfield twice all game, but he was nonetheless impressive in a 24-17 win over the Chargers. The smart coaching move was putting him into the pistol formation on occasion, and letting the running game do the heavy lifting.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the broadcast, NBC estimated that roughly 80 percent of the fans in L.A.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stadium were Pittsburgh supporters. On the season, road teams are 51-40-1 leaguewide. The NFC continues to dominate interconference play with a 19-10 record, even after the New York Jets\\xe2\\x80\\x99 win over Dallas.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more:'\n",

      "b'Even under ideal conditions, baking can be a bit of a dance \\xe2\\x80\\x94 reliant on the proper amount of ingredients, the right kind of interaction among them and a specific set of conditions, whether that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in your oven or the weather outside. Throw high altitude into the mix, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a whole new set of challenges.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we recently launched our Baking Basics newsletter, written by cookbook author and blogger Joy Wilson (a.k.a. Joy the Baker), we anticipated getting plenty of questions. We didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t anticipate so many about adapting the recipes to above sea level.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Get Voraciously\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Baking Basics newsletter and learn the techniques that make baking a piece of cake]\\r\\n\\r\\nThat doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily surprise Nicole Hampton, who grew up in Colorado, went to college in Boston and returned to a pile of baking frustrations. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen I came home, I was like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, cool, nothing works now,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d she says. Part of the impetus of her blog, Dough-Eyed, was to help her and other home cooks figure out how to work around the kinds of tricks high-altitude baking can play. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a guide to understanding why they happen and what to do about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe science. According to the Colorado State University Extension, the lower pressure at high altitudes has two major effects that can wreak havoc on baked goods. One, liquids evaporate faster and boil at a lower temperature. Two, the gases produced by leaveners (yeast, baking soda, baking powder) expand faster. Air at higher altitudes tends to be drier as well, so problems can begin even before you start cooking. Moreover, CSU says, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfood tends to taste blander at higher elevations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 see the more extreme example of terrible-tasting airline food.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give up. All that being said, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t assume your sea-level recipe will fail at a high altitude. CSU suggests trying a recipe first as written. Otherwise, how will you know what to tweak? Then you can begin manipulating one element at a time so you can keep track of what changes are causing which effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother wrinkle is that even if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve acquired a high-altitude-friendly recipe, it might not be right for your altitude, as all the effects amplify the higher you go. King Arthur Flour says microclimates in the mountains can mean even something that worked for your friend down the road might not work for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe keys are patience, meticulous testing and, yes, accepting that you might not succeed at first. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s super frustrating. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t possibly count the times that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made a recipe and had it fail,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hampton says. Even now, after years blogging and writing a cookbook called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSugar High\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on the topic, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tough to make the adjustment. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a process.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Still, the more you bake and the more recipes you perfect, the easier it will be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Bonnie S. Benwick for The Washington Post)\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral advice. Soon you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll understand what types of alterations work in your recipes in your kitchen. Hampton almost always starts any recipe by slightly reducing the leavener, since overexpansion is a fairly predictable outcome. Some sources recommend increasing the oven temperature by as much as 25 degrees and then reducing the baking time, the theory being that it will help the faster-rising baked goods set before they can collapse. Hampton, though, prefers to make other adjustments, because she has found that messing with the temperature can adversely affect texture. Whether you go that route is up to you, and probably the individual recipe.\\r\\n\\r\\nCSU offers a few other universal tips. One is to consider switching to a higher-protein flour, which strengthens structure. All-purpose flours can vary, so if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re using a brand on the lower end of the spectrum, such as Pillsbury or Gold Medal, considering switching to one with more protein, such as King Arthur Flour. Using extra-large eggs instead of large eggs can account for the drier atmosphere. You may find yourself needing to cut back fat and sugar since they become more concentrated at high altitude with the more aggressive evaporation of liquids.\\r\\n\\r\\n[How to choose the right flour for the right baking recipe]\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven all the variations I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve discussed so far, it can be hard to rely on specific adjustments that will apply across the board. However, CSU suggests some guidelines for cakes, quick breads and muffins to keep in mind as you experiment. For all altitudes, add up to 2 tablespoons more flour per cup called for in the recipe. For each cup of sugar, cup of liquid and teaspoon of baking powder or baking soda in the recipe (keep in mind that larger/more eggs can serve as liquid, too):\\r\\n\\r\\n3,500 to 6,500 feet: Reduce sugar up to 1 tablespoon, increase liquid 1 to 2 tablespoons, reduce baking powder/soda 1/8 teaspoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n6,500 to 8,500 feet: Reduce sugar up to 2 tablespoons, increase liquid 2 to 4 tablespoons, reduce baking powder/soda 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n8,500 to 10,000 feet: Reduce sugar 1 to 3 tablespoons, increase liquid 3 to 4 tablespoons, reduce baking powder/soda 1/4 teaspoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother option: If a recipe uses both baking soda and baking powder in conjunction with something acidic such as buttermilk or sour cream, KAF says you can try switching to just baking powder and regular milk, for a less powerful rising reaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Five tips to make you a better baker]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(Stacy Zarin Goldberg for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecifics. How do you tackle different types of baked goods? Read on.\\r\\n\\r\\nCookies: Hampton says these are the least affected by high altitude. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re small and cook quickly anyway. Often you can get away with very minor tweaks, and sometimes none at all. Consider slightly cutting the leavening. If the cookies spread too much, reduce the fat and sugar a little. If the dough seems too dry, add a bit more liquid.\\r\\n\\r\\nCakes: They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a bigger endeavor, according to Hampton, as getting the rise and structure correct is crucial to a cake that does not sink. Try making adjustments based on the suggestions above. As an example, for a two-layer, 8-inch cake, Hampton typically starts by adding 1/4 cup more flour to help with structure and 2 tablespoons liquid to account for the extra flour and drier air. For cakes that rely on beaten eggs (such as angel food or sponge), CSU says underbeating the eggs is important for keeping the cells formed by the air incorporated in the process from collapsing.\\r\\n\\r\\nPie crusts: Not too much to worry about here. All you may have to do is add a little extra water to the dough, in which case CSU suggests baking in the lower third of the oven to prevent a soggy crust.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiscuits, muffins and quick breads: CSU says these are usually sturdy enough to hold up even in a lower-pressure environment. If your baked good tastes slightly metallic or bitter, it may be because the baking soda or powder was not fully neutralized, so you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d want to reduce the amount. For more delicate quick breads, they may have to be treated and adjusted like cake.\\r\\n\\r\\nBread: Yeasted breads are by far the hardest recipes to adapt. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll want to disregard time suggestions on rising time, Hampton says, because the dough will poof up much faster. The problem with dough that has been proofed too much is that it is prone to collapse in baking. She often doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let it double in bulk either, assuming there will still be plenty of expansion in the oven. KAF suggests reducing the amount of yeast by 25 percent to prevent excessive rising. The problem with reducing yeast and rise time is that it can also reduce flavor. But you have a few options. Hampton likes to let dough rise in the fridge, which slows the rise but still allows for flavor development. And while many recipes call for one first rise, followed by punching down and shaping, KAF says you can do two initial rises, punching down the dough twice, so that you get flavor but not as much volume. Adding sourdough starter can help, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther tips. Hampton find that flavors don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come through quite as well up high, so she tends to amp up some ingredients to make them pop \\xe2\\x80\\x94 using a little more vanilla extract or Dutch-process cocoa powder instead of natural. Instant espresso powder contributes depth to chocolate baked goods (this applies at sea level as well). CSU suggests adding extra spices above 7,000 feet to fix bland-tasting food.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaying attention to visual cues in recipes is especially important since the time will likely change.

      "b'When I had agreed to foster this homeless canine family, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d pictured a merrier scene \\xe2\\x80\\x94 visions of puppies dancing like sugar plums in my head, perhaps. I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t thought out any snappish worst-case scenarios like this one.\\r\\n\\r\\nA favorite pet rescue group in Montgomery County, PetConnect Rescue, had put out a plea on social media: If someone could foster this mom and her pups, they could pull her out of the crowded, high-kill shelter where they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been abandoned. Their alternate ending was grim.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the pickup location, I saw something of myself in the worn-down dog\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 perhaps the universal struggle of motherhood. My present challenge involved a teen rough patch. Hers involved being dumped in a crowded shelter with a litter of puppies less than 24 hours old.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had broached the idea of fostering to my husband a few days before, I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expected him to think it was a good idea. The rough patch had left us both raw. Short fuses were set like traps around the house. Doors slammed. Voices raised. Much to my surprise, he agreed to my scheme.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nI was new to fostering. A PetConnect volunteer helped me set up the nursery that first day. Outside of her crate for the first time, the bony mother dog accepted a liver treat from my hand. I scooped kibble and mixed it with canned food and bone broth. Her puppies, more like hamsters, piled on a plush bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat on the floor after taking the mother dog for a walk that night. She wagged her tail, and though she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t trust me enough to sit next to me, she leaned toward me as if she wanted to. The next day, we repeated the routine. She put a paw on my leg when I sat on the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe let us help her. The boys gave her treats and took her for walks. They cradled the fragile 2\\xc2\\xbd-week-old puppies while I replaced wet bedding and made their mom her kibble and broth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she softened, so did our relationship with our sons. Night after night, instead of splitting off to our own corners, we humans lounged on the basement floor, admiring the puppies, observing their toothless gums, naming them and renaming them. The boys made a guide to tell them apart, listing names next to notes such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpink on half of nose\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhite heart on neck.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d They gently weighed each tiny puppy daily on an infant scale. We named the mom Fifi because she reminded us of Ruffina, a friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dog who had died. My own dog, a German shepherd named Tabby, spied on the operation from upstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nOn day four, Fifi, appearing slightly less gaunt, sat in my lap as if we were old friends. The puppies nursed with greed and had also gained weight. By the end of the first week, Fifi would continue nursing when I opened the door instead of jumping up in alarm. On day 10, she played with her puppies in front of me, throwing toys in the air, chasing balls and racing around the basement. Fifi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lackluster coat brightened to a beautiful fawn color. Her tail beat a happy rhythm. Her soft expression mirrored the softness I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d started to see on my boys\\xe2\\x80\\x99 faces.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the next few weeks, the pups\\xe2\\x80\\x99 timid play turned wild. We began daily outings into our fenced yard. The dogs discovered cool spring grass and puddles. They played chase and gnawed on a discarded, dried-up Christmas tree that scented their puppy breath with pine. Every evening ended with a perfect puppy pile.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a blissful time. Friends helped with walks for Fifi and donated dog toys and stacks of newspaper. Neighbors hung over the fence to chat and watch the puppies play. One curmudgeonly neighbor visited more than anyone for puppy snuggles while at the same time complaining nonstop about my time investment. Commuters on passing buses strained to catch a glimpse. Some got off a stop early to take part in our puppy parties. Bus drivers pulled over, pushing open their doors and holding up traffic on our corner to ask how to adopt. Eager teen visitors, having arrived on foot or on bikes hastily thrown down, miraculously ignored their phones for unprecedented periods.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it was blissful for other reasons: We watched as the boys seemed to forget their complaints and aggravations with us and each other. We had something consuming and constant to talk about that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to do with homework or their behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first adoption application rolled in \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for the male puppy my 12-year-old son called Slipper on account of his white feet \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when the litter was eight weeks old. We cringed in horror and then, selfishly, decided to adopt him ourselves. But we had to let the rest go. One by one, Slipper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s siblings got wonderful homes. Carl became Bailey and moved to Springfield. Rex went home with a family who had an RV and puppy-friendly camping adventures lined up for the summer. The girls \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Ava, Lola and Zoey \\xe2\\x80\\x94 all went to homes with kids to love. Fifi (a puppy herself at about 18 months old) found a forever home in the Virginia countryside where she has room to run. She also helps her owner, a PetConnect volunteer, care for and socialize homeless foster dogs and puppies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all went on to solid happily-ever-afters. Still, I cried when each one left. Neighbors comment on how big Slipper has grown now that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seven months old. Sometimes I think I see a bus driver slowing down to look for puppies in the yard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nSlipper continues to brings smiles to everyone he meets. Is it because he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grateful? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m grateful for the limitless happiness he spreads in our house. This sugar plum pays his good fortune forward every day with whipping full-body tail wags, snuggles and clownish antics that make our house merry again. Next spring, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take a test for certification as a volunteer therapy dog to spread his magic to kids in schools and hospitals, like Tabby does.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe puppies forced our family into much-needed moments of mindfulness. What else could we be but present when there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a litter of newborn puppies in the house? We needed that family project \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a happiness project, a compassion and kindness project, a put-down-our-phones project, a rush-home-to-be-part-of-it project \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a way out of the pit of tension we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been stuck in.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nFostering required much time and effort, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no denying that. But making room for Slipper and his family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kind of joy? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure anything has been easier, or more worthwhile.\\r\\n\\r\\nKitson Jazynka is a Washington writer.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow On Parenting on Facebook for more essays, news and updates, and join our discussion group here to talk about parenting and work.

      "b'It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just two exceptional teams and two successful organizations battling each other across Minute Maid Park\\xe2\\x80\\x99s diamond Sunday night in Game 2 of the American League Championship Series \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a classic, taut contest that stretched on for nearly five hours \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it was also two philosophies and two divergent blueprints for achieving the same essential goal: securing the 27 outs necessary to win a baseball game.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New York Yankees, a team built on relief pitching, went to their bullpen early and often. The Houston Astros, with one of the best rotations in the game, rode their future Hall of Fame starting pitcher as deep into the game as they could, then pieced it together from there. Each strategy had its own logic but also its own inherent dangers, especially as the game careened into extra innings.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, the Astros\\xe2\\x80\\x99 3-2 win wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t so much the validation of a philosophy as the result of one night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth of exceptional performance sprinkled with bits of good fortune \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but above all, it was a massive victory for the Astros themselves, who evened the best-of-seven series at one game apiece. And it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take 27 outs; it took 33.\\r\\n\\r\\nAstros shortstop Carlos Correa ended it with a majestic, no-doubt, opposite-field home run on the first pitch of the bottom of the 11th inning from Yankees lefty J.A. Happ, New York\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ninth pitcher of the night. Correa barely budged from the batter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s box at first, then casually tossed his bat, cupped his hand to the ear-hole of his helmet and strutted up the first base line, while his teammates spilled out of their dugout and a crowd of 43,359 went wild.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs soon as I hit it, I knew it was going over the fence,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Correa said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe adrenaline started pumping like crazy. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know what I did. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Obviously, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a moment that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to live with me forever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n[Astros\\xe2\\x80\\x99 dugout paramedic in stable condition after being struck by foul ball during ALCS Game 2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Monday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s travel day, the series resumes with Game 3 at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday, with Houston ace Gerrit Cole facing Yankees right-hander Luis Severino.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBefore the game, we were saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x98We have to win this game. We have to go to New York, 1-1,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Robinson Chirinos, who caught all 11 innings and 175 pitches for the Astros. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEverybody was talking about that. Thank God we split the series here at home, so we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to go to New York and take care of business there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSunday night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s game was an exquisite pitchers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 duel \\xe2\\x80\\x94 with offense scarce and the tension rising \\xe2\\x80\\x94 just not in the traditional sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nAstros starter Justin Verlander, a longtime Yankees postseason nemesis, limited them to two runs over his 6\\xe2\\x85\\x94 innings and 109 pitches, with both runs coming on Aaron Judge\\xe2\\x80\\x99s homer to center in the fourth. But the Yankees, more or less by design, got only seven outs from starter James Paxton, then cycled through their five best relievers to carry the game to extra innings. Navigating the 10th required the services of converted starters CC Sabathia and Happ.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI just felt like we were covered, as far as getting some length and having guys rested,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cObviously, going into an off-day [Monday], we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be aggressive. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Bottom line is, we end up giving up a third run in the 11th inning. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say from a run-prevention standpoint, we did pretty well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a seven-game series, it is remarkable how quickly fortunes can turn. After Saturday night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s win in Game 1, the Yankees gained home-field advantage and an immeasurable psychic benefit of beating the Astros in their home park. But suddenly, after Sunday night, it is the Yankees facing an unpleasant scenario, with Cole, the most unbeatable pitcher in the game at the moment, waiting for them in Game 3 and yet another injury crisis to face.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeft fielder Giancarlo Stanton, one of a record-setting 30 Yankees players who spent time on the injured list this season, suffered a strained quadriceps muscle in Saturday night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Game 1 and was left out of their lineup Sunday. His status is considered day to day, and any thought the Yankees might have of replacing him on their roster is tempered by the knowledge that doing so would also make Stanton ineligible for the World Series, should the Yankees advance.\\r\\n\\r\\n[These are the Astros and Yankees who will decide the ALCS]\\r\\n\\r\\nFew games in recent memory had witnessed so many rockets and lasers landing in gloves. The Astros alone hit at least six line drives directly at Yankees fielders for outs \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in some cases into the teeth of a well-designed shift. Both teams hit deep flyballs that appeared headed for the seats, only to die at the warning track \\xe2\\x80\\x94 part of a sustained pattern across the sport this month that has some questioning the properties of the postseason baseballs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEvery championship run, when you look back,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Verlander said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always moments throughout the course of a ballgame or a series [where it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s], \\xe2\\x80\\x98How did we win that game? What happened?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And I think tonight was nothing short of that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2-2 tie in the middle innings remained so through the top of the sixth only because of Correa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heads-up presence and elite arm. With runners on first and second and two outs, Brett Gardner hit a smash that one-hopped Astros second baseman Jose Altuve and caromed into shallow right-center field. As Yankees first baseman D.J. LeMahieu rounded third and headed home, waved in by third base coach Phil Nevin, Correa sprinted over, gathered it in and, from the outfield grass, fired a strike home to nail LeMahieu easily and end the inning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe talked to me before the game and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Jose, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do something big tonight,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Altuve said of his double-play mate, Correa. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe really did. When he made that play, I thought, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Okay.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Then he goes [to the plate] and hits a homer \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I love it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nVerlander pumped his fists coming off the mound, and Correa wagged his index finger \\xe2\\x80\\x94 no, no, no \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at no one in particular. But Verlander\\xe2\\x80\\x99s night ended three batters into the seventh. The Astros don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the same bullpen depth as the Yankees, but high-leverage slayer Will Harris got two critical outs, and closer Roberto Osuna, brought into a tie game in the eighth, collected five.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs you start to get to the end of it, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re both counting the number of pitchers we have left and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to maximize those guys,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Astros Manager A.J. Hinch said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou try not to run out of players. You try not to run out of pitching. But most importantly, you just try to win the game. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 This was an epic game in the playoffs with everything on the line. So obviously this has only just begun. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not drawing any conclusions. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing the best to put our players in the best position possible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Yankees, meanwhile, pulled starter Paxton after only 2\\xe2\\x85\\x93 innings, at which point he had allowed only one run and four hits, and in a one-run game they launched the nightly parade of relievers for which they have become known. This postseason, they have yet to push a starter beyond 86 pitches, and only veteran right-hander Masahiro Tanaka, in Game 1, has secured an out beyond the fifth inning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was expecting him a little bit longer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Altuve said of Paxton, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I was happy when they took him out of the game. He was throwing 98 with nasty curve balls and cutters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Astros have one weakness. The Yankees are built to exploit it.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst up Sunday night was right-hander Chad Green, who retired all six batters he faced, throwing just 26 pitches \\xe2\\x80\\x94 19 below his season high \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and he looked like he had more left when Boone pulled him, one batter into the fifth, in favor of Adam Ottavino. In doing so, Boone may have been guilty of thinking ahead to Game 3 and/or 4, hoping to conserve Green for later duty, rather than prioritizing winning the game in front of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the inherent risk in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbullpenning\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is that one weak link in the chain causes the whole thing to break down. With a one-run lead, the margin for error was tiny, and with Ottavino on the mound, the lead didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even last for one pitch. The right-hander served up a hanging slider that George Springer crushed over the Crawford Boxes in left, tying the score at 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nOttavino gave way to right-hander Tommy Kahnle for seven outs, then Kahnle to lefty Zack Britton for three. Closer Aroldis Chapman worked a scoreless ninth. That was all more or less by design.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut then came the 10th, and then the 11th \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the highly populated Yankees bullpen dwindling down to a lonely few. And then Correa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s homer was sailing into the seats, and the Yankees were staggering off the field, all that work and all that planning undone \\xe2\\x80\\x94 because baseball doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t follow anybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blueprint.'\n",

      "b'A few factors contributed to this placid acceptance of my postpartum shape: the euphoria of having just birthed a human; the hazy gloss of sleep deprivation from laboring overnight; and, most importantly, the fact that my baby now desperately needed nourishment from me. In that moment, the only thing I judged my body on was its ability to feed Audrey.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the days and weeks that followed, this mind-set held. I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t surprised that my anorexic thoughts didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t appear. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even register their absence. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d heard about the high caloric needs of breast-feeding women, and I ate. I did things that I never would have if my anorexia weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t dormant. I ate immediately upon waking, rather than making myself \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d food first. I ate in bed. I ate doughnuts. Years of experience had conditioned me to expect self-flagellation after such indulgences. Normally, I would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve forced myself to wear my skinniest pants afterward, both to prove that I could still fit into them and as penance, the feeling of the waistband digging into my flesh acting as a reminder that I had erred. Instead, I wore flowy dresses and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think to scrutinize my profile in reflections.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nMy new attitude was rewarded with each pediatric checkup, as our daughter grew in pounds and inches, her percentiles steadily rising. She started to fit into her baby clothes, and what clothes I fit into was of no importance. I looked in the mirror and saw a mother, a woman providing vital nutrition to her child. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t poke the soft flesh of my stomach. I forgave my thighs for touching one another in bed. I chuckled at my suddenly enormous breasts. My baby was growing, my milk was flowing and that was what mattered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis sudden freedom from the tyranny of anorexia may have been brought on by the breast-feeding itself. According to Christie Caggiani, a Florida-based dietitian and therapist specializing in eating disorders, the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates milk letdown, is linked to a sense of calm that can be helpful in mitigating eating disorder-related stress. She also says that breast-feeding provides an opportunity for building relationships and connection, something that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s often \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpainfully missing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for those struggling with eating disorders.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to say that breast-feeding, and being a mother, was a permanent cure for my anorexia. But after a few months, things changed. The metabolic requirements of breast-feeding outran my food intake and I started to lose weight. This is a well-documented phenomenon \\xe2\\x80\\x94 many mothers cite accelerated weight loss as a breast-feeding benefit \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but for someone with an eating disorder, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not an innocuous side effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly, I fit into my pre-pregnancy jeans. Strangers commented that they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d just had a baby. My anorexia woke up. I began scrutinizing what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been doing effortlessly for months, and questioning whether I really needed to be eating so much, gradually subtracting food and adding exercise. Before long, the pre-pregnancy pants didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just fit me; they fell off me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe potential reasons behind this shift are manifold. I now had to convince myself to eat for someone who was outside my body, a much more difficult notion to internalize than eating for a human I was growing inside me. Caggiani also says that eating disordered behaviors tend to spike during times of transition, and let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just say that going from a responsibility-free life in Brooklyn to motherhood in Sacramento was not an imperceptible change for me. Carla Manly, a California-based clinical psychologist, told me that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe anxiety-inducing periods of pregnancy and postpartum\\xe2\\x80\\x9d often worsen an eating disorder, despite a mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best efforts to prioritize her newborn.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy husband raised concerns, and I scheduled a call with my old dietitian, in the hopes that she could talk some sense into me. She did, to a certain extent, scaring me straight by telling me that breast-feeding while underweight could set me up for osteoporosis later in life, and that even if I produced enough milk, doing so at a low weight meant the milk could be leaching harmful elements such as mercury from my body.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at that point, the train was out of the station. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d decided, with the absurd but impenetrable logic of a person with an eating disorder, how many calories I could eat per day, and I would not exceed that number despite my ravenous hunger, fatigue or loose clothes. That old anorexic exceptionalism exhorted me: you can do both. You can lose weight, exercise through hunger, fit into the smallest size and still give your baby the sustenance she needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd for a while, I could. Until I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. When my daughter was just over five months old, my milk production plummeted. There are any number of reasons it happened. We cut out night feedings. We took a five-day trip without my pump. Or maybe it was just my body\\xe2\\x80\\x99s natural time to stop \\xe2\\x80\\x94 there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnormal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when it comes to how long a woman produces milk postpartum. Regardless, it became clear that my daughter was not getting the food she needed. When she wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take formula, I panicked. Instantly, the cacophony of eating disordered thoughts silenced and the important things came into stark relief. It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter that my arms looked skinny in a photo \\xe2\\x80\\x94 my baby had been hungry. I longed for the poochy bulge of my postpartum belly. I resolved to eat an enormous dinner, as if that would fix everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe soon found a formula my daughter took, but those two days of panic made it clear that anorexia had distorted my priorities. As Caggiani says, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbelieving that breast-feeding alone can be motivation to move someone into recovery is dangerous and misleading.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is, of course, fine to taper off breast-feeding at five months. Many women never breast-feed, and their babies grow into vibrant, healthy adults. Still, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m working to get back to the place where I was when my daughter was born, when maternal love and responsibility swept away the clutter of eating disordered thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nI may never get my milk supply back up, and she may never again be dependent on me for sustenance, but if I want my daughter to love and respect her own body, I need to do the same to mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nKate Willsky is a writer living in Sacramento.

      "b\"Advice columnist\\r\\n\\r\\nAdapted from an online discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHi, Carolyn: Now that I'm getting pretty good at setting boundaries (thank you for your help with that!), how do I stop feeling guilty about it?\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, I plan my entire week so I don't have to leave the house on Sundays. It's my day to spend time with my dogs, get things done around the house, or just sit around and watch old movies if that's what I want to do. My aunt texted me in a panic and asked me to come over and fix her TV last Sunday. I told her I couldn't do it that day but could do it the next day. She agreed after some begging and guilt-tripping.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I was still questioning myself two hours later. Would it really have been so bad to go over there for an hour? Well, yes, because I would have had to put off my housework and dig my car out of the snow just to fix a TV \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and there's another working TV in her house.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo why do I continue to feel guilty and think about it after the fact? This happens pretty much every time I say no to someone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Feeling Guilty\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(Nick Galifianakis/For The Washington Post)\\r\\n\\r\\nFeeling Guilty: When the only way you know to set boundaries is through reading and a few \\xe2\\x80\\x9caha\\xe2\\x80\\x9d moments and some deliberate new steps, it means you were raised not to have them and instead to say yes to everything because you were afraid you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be punished for it, if only through people not liking you for saying no to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of emotional training to have to undo. So be patient with yourself. The guilt problem might just go away with practice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso give some thought to what triggers these spasms of guilt. What if your aunt had just said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTomorrow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great \\xe2\\x80\\x94 thank you so much!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Would you have felt any guilt afterward for not dropping everything on the spot to go help?\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m guessing not. And that means you can do something to accelerate your progress toward living guilt-free: Recognize that you still feel the effects of other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need to reinforce your own conviction that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re entitled to choose how you use your time \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and others aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. This is the bedrock on which all good boundaries rest: the certainty that it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t selfish to have them.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust because panicky aunts have expectations of you, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re obligated to meet them; remind yourself of that whenever you feel people tugging at you from the other side of your boundary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt can also help to keep an eye out for people who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t guilt-trip you, and to reserve any special leave-the-house-on-Sunday kindnesses for them. Reward the behavior you appreciate, not the behavior that dredges up lingering feelings of guilt.\\r\\n\\r\\nRe: Guilt: What helped me was realizing the people in my life were used to guilt-tripping me all the time, because it worked! You are not just changing your habits, you are changing theirs. It is difficult to do, but you will be happier in the long run, and everyone, not just you, will adjust! Hang in there!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Anonymous\\r\\n\\r\\nAnonymous: Excellent point on retraining others, thanks.\"\n",

      "b'\\r\\n\\r\\nJulie Andrews in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Sound of Music.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Allstar Picture Library / Alamy Stock Photo)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following comes from the book \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHome Work: A Memoir of My Hollywood Years.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In this excerpt, Julie Andrews looks back on filming the iconic opening sequence of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Sound of Music.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIronically, most of our film\\xe2\\x80\\x99s magical opening sequence was the last thing we filmed in Austria. Robert Wise, our director, had envisioned an aerial shot to be filmed from a helicopter that would discover me \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a speck in the vast alpine landscape \\xe2\\x80\\x94 walking toward the camera. He selected a beautiful stretch of countryside high in the mountains, flanked by woods on two sides. Our huge playback speakers were camouflaged among the trees, as was our crew, so that no one else was in view.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was placed at one end of the meadow. A helicopter hovered behind the trees at the other end, waiting for me to begin my walk toward it. Initially, I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear my cue since the crew\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voices were muffled by the trees. Even the playback, turned up as loud as possible, was almost inaudible over the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclackety-clack\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the helicopter. Finally, Marc Breaux was given a bullhorn, through which he yelled, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGO, JULIE!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI began my walk, and as I did, the helicopter rose up and over its cover. It came at me sideways, looking rather like a giant crab. A brave cameraman named Paul Beeson was hanging out of it, strapped precariously to the side where a door would have been, his feet resting on the runners beneath the craft. Strapped to him was the heavy camera equipment. As the helicopter drew closer, I spun around with my arms open as if about to sing. All I had to do was walk, twirl, and take a breath. This required several takes, to be sure that both the helicopter and I hit our marks correctly, the camera was in focus, there was no helicopter shadow, and that everything timed out. Once the take was complete, the helicopter soared up and around me and returned to its original position. At that point I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d run back to the end of the field to start all over again, until Bob was satisfied that he had the perfect take.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem was that as I completed that spin and the helicopter lifted, the downdraft from the jet engine was so powerful, it dashed me to the ground. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d haul myself up, spitting mud and grass and brushing it off my dress, and trek back to my starting position. Each time the helicopter encircled me, I was flattened again.\\r\\n\\r\\nI became more and more irritated\\xe2\\x80\\x94couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they see what was happening? I tried to indicate for them to make a wider circle around me. I could see the cameraman, the pilot, and our second unit director on board, but all I got was a thumbs-up and a signal to do it again. Finally, the shot was deemed acceptable, and I was grateful to return to my hotel and take a long, hot bath.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time, largely due to the weather, we were three weeks behind schedule, seriously over budget, and the studio had summoned the rest of the cast back to L.A. We tried to capture the next small section of the song for several days, but the relentless rain thwarted our attempts yet again. Day after day, we waited for a break in the clouds, everyone cold, damp, and longing to go home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was still quite a bit left to shoot, as each small segment of the song was its own little scene. The brook, for example, was actually man-made, dug out by our crew, lined with plastic and filled with water, boulders, and ferns. Our host farmer lost patience with us, claiming that the film crew\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presence was disrupting his cows\\xe2\\x80\\x99 milk production. Overnight, he took a pitchfork to the plastic lining and punctured it enough times that all the water drained away. Bob was devastated\\xe2\\x80\\x94the 20th Century Fox bigwigs were hounding him to wrap things up, but they had no idea of the obstacles that he was wrestling with.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, Bob promised the studio that if he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get the last shot he was waiting for, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d wrap the company nonetheless and come home the following day. By some miracle, that afternoon the clouds parted for a brief half hour, the sun came out, and we got our shot. Bob later said that those constant lowering cumuli set against the magnificent Alps gave the film the drama and authenticity it needed \\xe2\\x80\\x94 something we couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have achieved any other way.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the book \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHome Work\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by Julie Andrews.

      "b'The English gardener and poet Marc Hamer spent much of his adult life catching moles for a living in the Welsh countryside. His wonderful book, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow to Catch a Mole,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is a beautiful, elegiac ode to a remarkable creature. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also an exploration of Hamer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life as he approaches his sunset years. Each page is filled with wonder, love, regret, humility and a sense of wonder (and oneness) with nature.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHaving worked all my life, created a family, discovered a home, I feel as secure as a working-class man ever feels,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he writes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI feel a sense of equality again with the crow and the toad and the hawthorn, with the rain and wind. I am them and they are me. . . .. I am just another animal, another tree, another wild flower in the meadow among billions of others. . . . There is something deeply magnificent in being just ordinary.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow to Catch a Mole,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d could be used as a guide to ridding a pest, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first a fine work of nature writing. Like all the classics of the genre \\xe2\\x80\\x94 J.A. Baker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Peregrine,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Eugene Marais\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Soul of the White Ant\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and John Lewis-Stempel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMeadowland\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it teaches us to look at the natural world anew, to develop eyes for the overlooked or the unseen. The book also delivers, via its furry central character, some useful life lessons.\\r\\n\\r\\nA mole can hear a human coming a half-mile away and when its tunnels are breached, it can sense the change in air pressure. Alert! Danger is afoot! \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf a mole comes across something it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hamer writes, \\xe2\\x80\\x9che either digs it out and pushes it to the surface, or he blocks the tunnel and digs around the problem. Undefeated, he makes more molehills. He is a master of survival strategy, the first rule of which is \\xe2\\x80\\x98Take a detour around the dangerous thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nClever mole. In \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Wind in the Willows,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he wears glasses for a reason. So a molecatcher needs patience, quietude and shrewdness. These are qualities Hamer has in abundance. At 16, Hamer left home, and over the course of the next 18 months, walked across Britain, honing the skills that make him a superlative mole catcher \\xe2\\x80\\x94 invisibility and placidness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen laying a trap, he made the mole\\xe2\\x80\\x99s home appear as undisturbed \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and palatable \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as possible. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI try hard to give him the world he wants,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hamer explains, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe one he expects and feels comfortable in.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great sadness of Hamer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s career is that he loves the animals whose lives he ended. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enjoy killing, so my methods had to be efficient, detached, fast and technical,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he writes. You get a sense that a small part of him died every time he trapped a mole. But Hamer became a molecatcher to assure himself the work was done humanely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn my early days as a gardener I was concerned that the few molecatchers I had come across showed little sensitivity, and that creatures were suffering. Looking back, of course, I have no idea what they felt. I judged them to be brutal men, but I am no different, not any more: the hammer shapes the hand, and I am moulded by the life I chose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nHamer is retired now. He refuses to kill moles anymore. He will, for a fee, advise people how to do it themselves, though he wishes they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d leave them be, as they do in Germany and Austria, where the European mole is a protected species.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead Hamer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wondrous book, then explore your yard.

      "b'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe author Ali Wong. (Stephanie Gonot)\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Ali Wong\\xe2\\x80\\x99s preschool-age daughters ever actually read the comedic memoir meant for them, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Girls: Intimate Tales, Untold Secrets & Advice for Living Your Best Life,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they will collect some mighty off-color visuals of dear ol\\xe2\\x80\\x99 mom \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and, uh, best of luck trying to unsee them. Wong\\xe2\\x80\\x99s swaggery comedy is already a trove of now-iconic imagery, like the not-so-maternity mini dresses she wore while hugely pregnant in her starmaking Netflix specials, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBaby Cobra\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (2016) and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHard Knock Wife\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (2018) (she is donating one to the Smithsonian, and both have become popular feminist Halloween costumes); and the extra-stark realities she shares onstage about life after giving birth, from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbull\\xe2\\x80\\x99s-eye\\xe2\\x80\\x9d nipples to exploding milk to, well, actual afterbirth. But in her first book, she paints even more indelicate pictures, in every shade of blue. There is the scene where she pees on her husband, Justin, while he is trimming her pubic hair; the ayahuasca hallucination where she gives herself oral sex; the recurring shtick of splashing water on her nether-regions before a romp; and even the relatively clean, yet still blech-inducing, Biore pore strip she yanks off the nose of her blackhead-infested mother. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe white piece of paper looked like a hairbrush afterward,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wong writes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was so deeply satisfying.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nPost-\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBaby Cobra,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wong seemingly exploded into A-list status \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you know, the old \\xe2\\x80\\x9covernight\\xe2\\x80\\x9d success story of someone who pounded the pavement outside freeway-adjacent motels for years. So for come-lately fans wondering, Where did this tiny filthy phenom come from?!, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Girls\\xe2\\x80\\x9d fills in the gaps. Wong\\xe2\\x80\\x99s study abroad program to her mom\\xe2\\x80\\x99s native Vietnam, for example, proved culturally and ideologically formative, leaving her with a taste both for exploring the outer limits of her comfort zone \\xe2\\x80\\x94 so crucial to her brand of comedy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and for eating fertilized duck embryos. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was practically still alive,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she writes of first ingesting the delicacy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut after that moment I became really intolerant of anybody who got grossed out by something other people in the world ate for breakfast every day. Just shut the [expletive] up and eat a duck baby.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWong\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skyrocketing success of late \\xe2\\x80\\x94 from selling out mega venues on her Milk & Money tour, to starring in, co-writing and producing the hit Netflix rom-com \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlways Be My Maybe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 gets lassoed down to earth with humbling, early-years anecdotes about fearing for her life on seedy tours, trying out material in clubs that doubled as laundromats and bombing in front of Eddie Murphy. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI knew Eddie Murphy specifically wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t laughing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wong writes, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecause everyone knows when Eddie Murphy is or isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t laughing. You could recognize his signature \\xe2\\x80\\x98HANH-HANH-HANH\\xe2\\x80\\x99 goose honk anywhere. And that night, there were no geese.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Girls\\xe2\\x80\\x9d can be crude and flippant, LOL-dense and breezy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 so breezy, in fact, you will be desensitized to the grossest of Wong\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gross-outs by chapter one, at which point you have already learned how to hold in a fart during yoga. But as with her stage comedy, she is also sneakily thoughtful about the public roles she occupies \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Asian American, working mom, woman on comedy stages \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and the come-from-behind grind they necessarily demand. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cConvincing an audience that a person who looks like me could be funny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she writes, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand proving to them that I belonged onstage, was a steep uphill battle.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She even offers surprisingly tender takes on her immigrant-minded parents, her sensitive husband (who contributes his own chapter as an afterword) and motherhood, the match that lit her career on fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nWong\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daughters should consider themselves lucky to have a self-made, cultural touchstone for a mother, let alone one doling out personalized advice about dating rappers, the importance of travel and surefire signifiers of a worthy Chinese restaurant: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe pork and shrimp will arrive right away, but it takes an hour to get a glass of water.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But if they indeed tuck into this memoir, they will learn more than they ever cared to \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in vibrant technicolor, yikes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 about mom\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sex life. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear Girls,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and all readers it may concern: In print, Wong is every inch the crass-master she plays on TV, so gird your gag reflex.\\r\\n\\r\\nRachel Rosenblit is a freelance writer and editor in New York.'\n",

      "b'Theater critic\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be welcomed, respectfully, into a theater and yet be told the performance isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really meant for you makes for an unusual psychological adjustment. This admonitory greeting isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily a turnoff; it just forces you into an un\\xc2\\xador\\xc2\\xadtho\\xc2\\xaddox posture: I may be wanted here, but not to the extent that others are. How does that make me feel?\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, if you are even casually acquainted with the concept of injustice, you wrestle against defensiveness and pay attention. Because even though the actors tell you that the rituals of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat to Send Up When It Goes Down\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are primarily for black audience members, people of any color can \\xe2\\x80\\x94 yes, I think, must \\xe2\\x80\\x94 relate to the anguish flowing through this intense and edifying experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nAleshea Harris\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance piece, presided over by an accomplished and impassioned cast of eight, plunges all of its patrons into a river of outrage. America in 2019 remains a den of inequity, insofar as insults to African American hearts and bodies are concerned. In \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat to Send Up When It Goes Down,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the violence perpetrated against black people by police is the jumping-off point for an exercise that starts in a mournful cataloguing of those insults, passes through stages of anger \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and ends, for some spectators, in tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nWoolly Mammoth Theatre has brought the production by New York\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Movement Theatre to Washington and, in a smart and embracing gesture, arranged bookings for it outside its own building downtown, at prices as low as $5. The Duke Ellington School of the Arts was its first stop over the weekend; the show travels Thursday to Howard University; and then to THEARC in Anacostia, before settling in for a run at Woolly Mammoth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a moment in which playwrights of color are shedding the curtain of metaphor and opening stages to plainer talk about America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s racial failures. Jeremy O. Harris\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSlave Play,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a new sensation on Broadway, pokes fun at the pieties of white liberals who seek to absolve themselves from accusations of racial cluelessness; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSoft Power\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by David Henry Hwang, which has its official opening this week at off-Broadway\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Public Theater, explores the branding of never-American-enough with which some Asian Americans say they must contend. In her Pulitzer Prize-winning \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFairview,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which just ended a run at Woolly, white audiences are challenged even more directly by its author, Jackie Sibblies Drury, who asks that they leave their seats, sit on the stage and confront head-on the cultural divisions that racism has fostered and sustained.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe least white playgoers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who remain an overwhelming majority on most nights in the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mainstream theaters \\xe2\\x80\\x94 can do is come and hear them out, these dramatists seem to be saying. Theater has long been receptive to the voices of marginalized artists and groups, on the fringes certainly, and sometimes, even on its bigger stages. In \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat to Send Up When It Goes Down,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Harris tweaks this open-arms tradition by having an actor inform ticket holders at the door that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are glad non-black people are here. We welcome you, but this piece was created and is expressed with black folk in mind. If you are prepared to honor that through your respectful, conscientious presence, you are welcome to stay.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe experience you wade into turns out to be meaningful, regardless of your skin color. The first portion is participatory: the audience forms a circle and you are guided through several gentle bonding activities. The eight actors join us. They are Denise Manning, Javon Q. Minter, Beau Thom, Alana Raquel Bowers, Nemuna Ceesay, Rachel Christopher, Ugo Chukwu and Kambi Gathesha. Under Whitney White\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intuitively moving direction, they ask us then to take seats around the space for a performance of barbed skits tallying the daily dignity violations of surviving in white America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe audience on my evening at Duke Ellington was equally divided between black and non-black playgoers; you could feel everyone tense up a bit, as the grievances outlined in the storytelling sank in. (The polished actors perform \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat to Send Up\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in street clothes, adding in some a cappella singing and employing a few basic props.) The show culminates in a scene that memorializes the worst of the violations racism continues to engender, especially for young black men.\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw wet cheeks around the room on black faces, brown faces, white faces. Tragedy conjured on a stage with fire and grace can transfix anyone, regardless of what your life has been like before coming through the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat to Send Up When It Goes Down, by Aleshea Harris.

Arruda has made a career from the game and gained more than 530,000 subscribers to his YouTube channel, where he uploads instructional gameplay montages.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nA week before the start of RLCS season eight, The Post tapped into Squishy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rock-solid understanding of the game\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mechanics to help aspiring players emulate his moves.\\r\\n\\r\\nPractice with training packs. A lot.\\r\\n\\r\\nArruda said any serious Rocket League player should spend 30 minutes to an hour training in free-play mode before starting their first match.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA lot of pros would say the same,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA lot of their time is in free play.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he was starting out, Arruda said he only practiced in free play because he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have an Internet connection to compete against others. Now, players can utilize all the training packs from Rocket League \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and countless more from the community \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to hone specific skills or run set plays.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nArruda\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recommendation: Make the most of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nUse time in training to focus on controlling the ball in the air and winning it off nearby walls, Arruda said. Fancier moves, such as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmusty flip,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are fun to master and well-received on the community hubs such as the Rocket League subreddit, but remember there are no style points in competitive matches.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be going for unnecessarily flashy stuff if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to be useful,\" Arruda said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWork on different skills in different modes\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re ready for a match, take a moment to mull over what mode to pick \\xe2\\x80\\x94 whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1v1, 2v2 or a traditional 3v3 match.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne-on-one games allow for more opportunities to practice dribbling and ball control. By nature, the matches are a series of 50-50 matchups, and those situations prepare players for the rare occasions when you find yourself with just one defender to beat in a traditional match.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, 2v2 matches help players mitigate risk, Arruda said. One fewer player on the field forces you to play more conservatively on the ball, helping you build up a better instinct for when to challenge the ball and when to drop back.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd finally, in a 3v3 match, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll want to practice rotating off the ball with teammates. Arruda said two of the most important details to team play are spacing and anticipating the next touch on the ball.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt all comes down to being able to read the game,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn defense, control the ball; don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t clear it\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on defense, always dribble or pass the ball out of your half of the pitch.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlayers can develop bad habits by simply clearing the ball for their opponents to control and bring back. In short, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll create a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cping-pong\\xe2\\x80\\x9d effect where you have few opportunities for a clear shot on goal. As in many sports, possession is key.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you get possession, there are a few ways to put the opposing team on its heels, Arruda said. Take their boost from the back corners and, after that, get the ball in the air to force players to challenge the ball on their heels.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re pretty much just trying to put them in a position where they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to second-guess their decisions every time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Arruda explained.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nWatch the tape\\r\\n\\r\\nExcelling at Rocket League starts with incremental improvements. Arruda does not recommend using your recent match record as an indication that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbetter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ranked matches will always place you against progressively better players if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re winning, or worse players if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing, so using your record can be a bit flawed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nSave a match on your console and watch the tape a month or so later. That way, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to see how much you have improved over time. Replays also help show the flow of the game. Use the perspective to your advantage, Arruda said. Watch when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been scored on and why. Try to find trends or gaps in your defense. Often, teams are exposing the same mistake for most of their goals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe thing about pro-level gameplay is you have maybe one to two seconds max with the ball,\" Arruda said. \"So you have to do something within that time period.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessional play in RLCS matches has become a series of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmind games on mind games,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Arruda said, with players feinting off the ball to expose the defense. As soon as you hesitate, it becomes an opportunity for a goal. The best advice Arruda has is to be decisive and fully commit when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re challenging a ball.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou just got to trust your instinct,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Arruda said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no time to hesitate in this game. You have to be going, like, full speed almost the entire time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more:\\r\\n\\r\\nAD'\n",

      "b'There has been a steady drumbeat of attention for the sandbox builder. Mojang, the company behind the game, released two major updates in the past year or so. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also working on two new offshoots of the original game. One is an augmented-reality experience for your phone (think Pok\\xc3\\xa9mon Go) and the other, Minecraft Dungeon, is an RPG similar to Diablo.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nSwedish YouTube creator PewDiePie returned to Minecraft in June, bringing with him one of the largest audiences on the platform. He has already posted more than 100 Minecraft-themed videos. Some of the biggest Fortnite streamers are even swinging their pickax. Depending on how you play, some streamers have said Minecraft can be a welcome respite from the grinding gameplay of battles royal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEveryone has kind of been starved when it comes to creativity, and Minecraft allows them to sort of express that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d professional Fortnite streamer Ali \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMyth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Kabbani recently told The Post. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice break from the usual.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking to return to mining or maybe create a new world for the first time, The Post talked with two YouTube creators \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Preston Arsement of PrestonPlayz and Tyler Pappas of logdotzip \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and asked for their advice.\\r\\n\\r\\nPick an edition: Bedrock or Java\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, there are two slightly different versions of the main game \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Bedrock and Java.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nJava is the original version. It remains a hub for hobbyists who want to modify the game in their own custom servers. Minecraft, at its core, is an incredibly flexible game. People have created servers to play versions of Pok\\xc3\\xa9mon. There are countless libraries online for Minecraft enthusiasts to play and alter older versions of the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nBedrock is the multiplatform edition of Minecraft, which allows players to mine with friends on other devices \\xe2\\x80\\x94 phones, consoles, etc. In Bedrock, rather than adding lines of code to modify the game, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a setup marketplace for the community.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe marketplace is basically this thriving ecosystem that takes the best of user-generated content and lets the player base purchase it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pappa said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot only to expand their gameplay experiences but to directly support the teams behind it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nBedrock is a bit more buttoned-up and probably the future of the franchise with its cross-platform capabilities, while Java is the tried-and-true edition for some hardcore fans.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the beginning, find your village people\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re starting a new survival world in Minecraft, Pappa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recommendation is to get to the nearest village. These towns, and the villagers in them, are more important than ever after recent updates to the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nVillages will provide a roof over your head and an empty bed for those dark early days playing Minecraft. You can live off their crops and use the towns as a home base, at least until you build a house of your own.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on your own two feet, Pappa said you should make use of the utility blocks around town \\xe2\\x80\\x94 even \\xe2\\x80\\x9cborrow\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a few to place in your future home. Grindstones, smokers, stone cutters and other utility blocks are all available for players to forge new items or craft more efficiently.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nOne update from Mojang has expanded on how and what you can trade with villagers. If you make the most of it, trading can become a simple way to get your hands on rare items, Pappa said. Protect the villagers from the aptly named \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpillagers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a new spawn in the game that will attack in coordinated raids, and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get better deals in trades with the townspeople.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making it more interactive and having more of an experience past beating the Ender Dragon,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Arsement said.\\r\\n\\r\\nGo for a swim, play with animals\\r\\n\\r\\nYou could always swim in Minecraft, but a year ago Mojang provided a reason to explore the ocean depths with an Aquatic update. There are sunken ships, treasure maps, tridents and, yes, underwater zombies. You can build your next humble abode underwater, Pappas said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what an exciting concept, right?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBuild underwater, give it an air dome. Watch as fish swim by your head.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re down there, swim with the dolphins or the puffer fish. Speaking of both, Minecraft now has more than your typical farm animals in the game \\xe2\\x80\\x94 with bees, pandas, turtles and foxes that huddle into their own tail for a quick nap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMinecraft is a very relaxing game,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pappas said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got lovely piano music in the background. Fun cute animals to look at. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no impetus to kill everyone and get first place, and I think that resonates with a lot of people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pappas said, referring to Fortnite and other battle royal games.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, despite all the new bells and whistles, the core game hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t changed. Minecraft remains a massive sandbox to jump into whether you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking to explore \\xe2\\x80\\x9can endless procedurally generated world\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or just create with a digital Lego set, Pappas said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s essentially a platform in which we can do whatever we want,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pappas said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what has allowed it to survive for the last decade.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more from The Post:\\r\\n\\r\\nAD'\n",

      "b'Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s their advice to upgrade your game:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Be quiet and listen\\r\\n\\r\\nRegistering and understanding noise is a huge key to helping you win. If you listen closely enough, you can predict what the enemy will do. Likewise, manage your own noise so you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make your movements so obvious.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nUbisoft developed its own sound propagation system to make the game as realistic as possible. In typical games, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll hear a noise from an adjacent room, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s muffled. In Siege, noise travels from person to person through space in the shortest way possible, bouncing off walls and entering through doorways.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nNiclas \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPengu\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mouritzen, flex player for the G2 Esports Siege team, said managing noise is something he and his teammates constantly work on. For example, jumping with your drone is quite loud, making it easy for enemies to track it down and destroy it. Mouritzen cautioned to only jump away if your drone is in danger of being destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne tip people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think about, Mouritzen said, is that shooting out windows allows you to hear inside. Sound won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t filter through the room unless the window is destroyed. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the small things that are make or break in a realistic game like Siege.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Learn the maps until you can see them blindfolded\\r\\n\\r\\nRainbow Six Siege features highly dynamic, destructible, multilevel maps. You can get shot from just about anywhere, which can make it frustrating to play for beginners.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nGabriel \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLaXInG\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mirelez from Team Reciprocity, who has played competitively for 3\\xc2\\xbd years, said he had the same issues as many other players in the beginning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe classic Siege line of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know you could die from there\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was a regular occurrence for Mirelez. But the difference between him and many others, he said, was the drive to improve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you want to improve, you really have to want it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mirelez said. Doing the same thing over and over again isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to cut it in a game like Siege.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nHe recommends watching professional gameplay and high-level streamers to understand the best angles to take in a map. Keep yourself protected as much as possible while giving yourself the best angle to scope your enemies.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Equip the right scope and attachments to fit the occasion\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of finding success in Siege is knowing which operator fits your situation and play style. More than that, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need to figure out which scopes to use when you are defending or attacking.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game narrows down the scopes you can use in particular situations. Attackers and only a few defenders have the option of using ACOG, a scope with 2x magnification, but selecting it all the time isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the best option. It forces you to hold and angle and rely on the enemy to make a mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in close-quarters combat, Mouritzen said, 1x sights, such as reflex and red dot, are king. They let you take things into your own hands and improve upon fragging (kills). However, if you are playing a support operator such as Thermite, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best to hang back and hold down an angle with an ACOG sight.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Use the right virtual and physical equipment\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important that you nail down mechanics. In Siege, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need to be able to do a 180 on a dime and shoot first.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour mouse is the key to it all. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to find a mouse that fits your hand comfortably. That won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily be the one that the pros are using, Mouritzen said. Sometimes they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re using a mouse that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part of a sponsorship deal, so it may not work for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nTo calibrate your 180 game, align your mouse at the center of the mouse pad, turn 180 degrees to the left and return back to the center in one quick motion. If you can do that, you should have a good setup, Mouritzen said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to your own hardware, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the virtual equipment to which each operator character has access. Blitz uses a riot shield that acts as a flashbang, Echo has a quadcopter drone that can disorient people, and Kaid electrifies shields, hatches and barbed wire with his Electroclaw. Understanding how this equipment synergizes with the rest of your team will help you to victory.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Stack the odds\\r\\n\\r\\nTop of mind for the pros is kills, objective, survival rate and trade \\xe2\\x80\\x94 also known as KOST. Some of the terms are obvious, like kills refers to eliminating opponents and the objective is how you approach planting/disarming the bomb or holding an area. Survival rate is about improving your odds at living through an engagement, while trades refer to making opponents pay if they take out one of your teammates. Each of those concepts factors into a player\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision-making. What this really boils down to, Mouritzen said, is doing whatever it takes to give your team an advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nAD\\r\\n\\r\\nIf someone kills a teammate, are you able to at least trade the kill? Can you bring in another person to help clear a room? How can you leverage a numbers advantage? It all has to do with odds.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking a 50-50 gunfight might work, but it can just as well cost you the game if you lose. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably not a worthwhile fight to pick. Efficient allocation of resources (teammates, drones, grenades, equipment, etc.) given the situation can change the odds to 80-20, the pros say, and help you confidently take a fight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cClutching is great, but odds are much higher if you match the manpower,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mourtizen said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a team game, after all.\\r\\n\\r\\nRead more from The Post:\\r\\n\\r\\nAD'\n"
